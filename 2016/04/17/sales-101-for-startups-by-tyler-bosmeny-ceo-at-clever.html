        </header>

        <section itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><img src="/images/fulls/20160417post.jpeg" title="Sales 101 for Startups by Tyler Bosmeny (CEO at Clever)" alt="Sales 101 for Startups by Tyler Bosmeny (CEO at Clever)" class="fit image" /> I don’t watch movies or series. My friends have grown accustomed to this and they know I prefer wasting my time on something else. For instance, watching live concerts or business talks.</p>

<p>I know I’m part of a really rare minority who’d rather spend one hour a half a day watching live versions of the same rock songs to see how the guitar player evolved the solo over time, or one-hour long fireside chats with leading entrepreneurs - like the ones we do at <a href="http://www.startupgrind.com" title="Startup Grind" target="_blank">Startup Grind</a>, rather than indulging in keeping up with all the wonderful series that are being released every week.</p>

<p>I wish I could enjoy that, but I do not. I get my dose of brain-numbing stuff by watching football, reading lots or having drinks with friends.</p>

<p>Thus, when most of my friends comment on the latest Game of Throne episode, I am never part of the conversation. Just like when I talk business to other entrepreneurs and I mention “did you watch that fireside chat where Vinod Koshla got pissed at the journalist interviewing him?”, I almost everytime get a blank starte denoting a brain 404-error (“Page not found”).</p>

<p>However, I know there are others like me out there, and every now and then I encounter some and have very insightful conversations. Therefore, I will start doing recaps of these talks for people who are just <i>missing out</i> on great stuff.</p>

<p>Here’s a recap for this Sales 101 that Tyler Bosmeny (CEO @ Clever) gave at Y-Combinator:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHAh6WKBgiE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Let’s get the party started:</p>

<h3 id="sales-are-best-done-by-founders">Sales are best done by founders</h3>

<p>Before ever considering hiring sales people for your startup, take a look at your founding team. Why wasting your precious resources on hiring sales reps that might get you nowhere, need to be trained, won’t be very flexible adapting to product pivoting and other startup nuisances?</p>

<p>It could be worse: you might not even have those resources. Therefore, time is the only resource you have.</p>

<p>Get one of the founders to be focused on sales. Founders are great sales people because you know the pitch like no-one else, you’ve got the passion for your product/company and you’ve got the industry knowledge. I will add something more here, if you allow me: we, the founders, have got the conviction of having a roadmap in our head, thus allowing us to get out of every uncomfortable question.</p>

<h3 id="the-sales-funnel-prospecting">The sales funnel: Prospecting</h3>

<p><img src="/images/fulls/20160417prospection.png" title="Market Prospection" alt="Market Prospection" class="fit image" /></p>

<p>When Tyler describes the first phase of the almighty sales funnel (Prospect) as the figure above. Allegedly, there are many people interested in your product, but you need to focus on that small 2.5% that will jump on your wagon no matter what.</p>

<p>Tryin to drag the so-called early adopters in won’t result. Early adopters will join once there’s traction or enough content/users in the platform to make it interesting, even at an early stage. The innovators will join regardless of all of that.</p>

<p>How to get to these people? Tyler recommends three actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Digging through your personal network</strong> and reaching out personally to all of them that might potentially be an innovator.</li>
  <li><strong>Attending conferences</strong>. But not big ones like Websummit, Mobile World Congress and such, where you’re just another fish in the ocean. Attend focused and specialised conferences where 100% of the people there might turn into customers: seminars for CFOs, sales workshops, developer bootcamps, etc. Also, emailing all the attendees before the event to schedule meetings is usually a great idea.</li>
  <li><strong>Cold emailing</strong> is useful, as practice makes the master. The more you write, the better you will become and the sharper your message will become. Try to be concise and aim for short emails that are straight to the point to maximise your success rate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-sales-funnel-conversation">The sales funnel: Conversation</h3>

<p>Tyler analysed the amount of time he spent talking on the phone versus the one he spent listening. This is something he learnt from the top 10% sales people in the world: the best sales calls are spent 70% of the time listening, 30% talking.</p>

<p>Most entrepreneurs are so excited when someone takes their calls, that they stall firing on all cylinders and overwhelming the person on the other side of the line with an avalanche of information. This is overkill.</p>

<p>Try instead asking relevant questions and making the other person feel comfortable. You will get them to open up if you ask questions that tackle their own problems: “how is your ideal CRM?”, “what struggles do you face daily when hiring sales personnel?”, “how would you improve bottlenecks on sales decisions?”, etc.</p>

<p>Another great piece of advice I would like to point out is that most people, even those willing to buy your product, are not going to answer or follow up. You should try to be <i>politely persistent</i>, as Mark Suster put it in his blog entry <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2014/03/29/one-of-my-most-frequent-pieces-of-advice-be-politely-persistent/" title="One of My Most Frequent Pieces of Advice: Be Politely Persistent">One of My Most Frequent Pieces of Advice: Be Politely Persistent</a>. Get their YES or NO as soon as possible to focus on the potential customers that really matter and will drive your sales figures up.</p>

<h3 id="the-sales-funnel-conversion">The sales funnel: Conversion</h3>

<p>So you say you’re about to land your first client, but you don’t have a contract. Where can you get one? You’re so focused on product, tech, HR and managing the company that you haven’t had time to think about this.</p>

<p>Luckily, YCombinator have outsourced their sales documents. Use them. They’re great! Find them here: https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/</p>

<p>At this point, Tyler advises the audience to avoid the following rookie mistakes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t quibble over minor points:</strong> Sign the deal, move forward, and then work that out by building a great relationship with your customer.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t build extra stuff to get a contract</strong>: Don’t take clients that will use your product if you tailor it for them. That means, they don’t really want your product, and the effort you spend developing new features could be used to look for better clients who appreciate what you offer. To solve this, you can either sign a conditional agreement whereby they pay you to build <em>that</em> feature or else you could wait to hear demand from more customers.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t offer free trials</strong>: They don’t give you real clients, nor commitment neither revenue. Tyler strongly advises to work on annual contracts with a 30- or 90-days opt-out period.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>I thoroughly subscribe what Tyler says and hope you have enjoyed this recap. Watch his great talk to get into a deeper level of detail!</p>
