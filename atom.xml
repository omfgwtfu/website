      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160814.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160814.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;People sitting in the porch of a Guesthouse&quot; alt=&quot;People sitting in the porch of a Guesthouse&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; I’m pretty sure that you remember getting excited the first time you looked at Google Analytics. What would happen if I told you that most of those visits were yours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it, unless you tell Google Analytics to block your very own visits, &lt;strong&gt;you will be counted as another visitor&lt;/strong&gt;, and therefore accumulate rubbish data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might sound appealing to show off the number of visits that you have, even if they are fake, for some short-term strategies, like reporting to investors, potential partnerships or other deals. But unless you fail to deliver after the deal is done, you will be just cheating at solitaire. I do not recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, I suggest we all play fair. Here’s how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-create-a-google-analytics-account&quot;&gt;Step 1: Create a Google Analytics account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think Google Analytics needs introduction, but it’s basically one of the most used Google products out there. In short, it helps you to track your website’s visitors over time and provides you with tonnes of useful data (if you know how to read it, that is!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click here to &lt;a href=&quot;http://analytics.google.com&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;create a Google Analytics account&lt;/a&gt;. The process is simple enough, but if you get lost in the process check our their &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics help page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;help page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, you will have to include the Google Analytics code into your website. I could not explain it better than them, so you better check their &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics Help System&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;help system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-log-in-to-your-account&quot;&gt;Step 2: Log in to your account&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the signup process, you will have registered your “account”, which is what you select in the first screen you see after the login. This is the screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160814.png&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics landing page&quot; alt=&quot;Google Analytics landing page&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;These are some of the websites I own.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you select your website, you will be presented with the website’s dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-create-the-filter&quot;&gt;Step 3: Create the filter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before doing that, we might want to find out what is our IP address. Easy as a pie: just Google &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=what%27s+my+ip&amp;amp;oq=what&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59j69i65l3j69i60.1703j0j1&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot; title=&quot;What's my IP&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s my IP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it will return something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160814ip.png&quot; title=&quot;IP Address&quot; alt=&quot;IP Address&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;That's my IP right now. Come hack me!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we will go to the Administration tab, and we will be presented with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160814admin.png&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics administration panel&quot; alt=&quot;Google Analytics administration panel&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Google Analytics Administration Panel&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on &lt;em&gt;All Filters&lt;/em&gt; and then &lt;em&gt;Add Filter&lt;/em&gt;. Once you’re there, fill in the form with the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filter Name: Whatever you want that will help you identify this filter (if you’ve got many).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filter Type: Predefined.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dropdowns: &lt;em&gt;Exclude&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Traffic from the IP addresses&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;that are equal to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IP Address: The number you’ve gotten from Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll have to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160814filter.png&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics filters&quot; alt=&quot;Google Analytics filters&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;This is how a filter in Google Analytics looks like&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bonus-create-an-additional-filter-to-block-localhost&quot;&gt;Bonus: Create an additional filter to block localhost&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, the filter we have created above only works if you’re accessing the website once it’s published. But if you’re working with a local version (for instance, I am using Jekyll), you will be accessing (and therefore logging accesses) from 127.0.0.1 (localhost).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do two things to avoid this. If you’re a developer, you can add Google Analytics as an environment variable so it only loads once the website is live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not a developer, or just do not want to deal with that, you can create the following filter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160814localhost.png&quot; title=&quot;Google Analytics filter to block localhost&quot; alt=&quot;Google Analytics filter to block localhost&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Google Analytics filter to block localhost&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all, folks! Hope you enjoyed the read and / or have found it useful. What else can I help you with?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Extraterrestrial Experience at Project Youngfish</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/08/09/My-Extraterrestrial-Experience-at-Project-Youngfish.html" />
      <updated>2016-08-09T13:43:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/08/09/My-Extraterrestrial-Experience-at-Project-Youngfish</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160809.jpg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160809.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit mentoring at Project Youngfish&quot; alt=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit mentoring at Project Youngfish&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Fostering entrepreneurship is admittedly one of the hottest trends nowadays. But far from being merely a passing phase, creating new entrepreneurs has become something essential in our society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once, entrepreneurs were only known as people who created a startup / business for very different reasons. In the last years, however, we have seen the rise of the entrepreneur in many forms: intrapreneurs, serial entrepreneurs, gurus specialising in just one market (IoT, e-commerce, fintech, etc.), and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I wanted to talk about social entrepreneurship. Projects whose main goal is to create social impact, to improve the conditions of a region regarding one or many of the following areas: unemployment, pollution, access to clean water, poverty, access to school, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-youngfish-project&quot;&gt;Enter Youngfish Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last June, I was invited by Makers of Barcelona to give a one-day lesson about sales and marketing in Project Youngfish. Project Youngfish is a two-weeks program for unemployed young individuals who want to kickstart projects with a high social impact. This edition took place in Valencia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My class was included in the second week of the program, and it should see the different groups ironing out the last details of their projects, and preparing the demo show scheduled for the last day of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I was tremendously surprised not only by the great ideas (everyone has ideas, in my opinion) but of their language skills – as the program is partly conducted in English – and their previous experience. Some of the participants had owned companies in the past or participated in really cool projects. I was taken aback, as I was expecting a less experienced audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of all the projects, I chose two as my favourites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one, because of its creativity and vision. One of the groups, let’s call it Group A, wanted to create a B2B marketplace where designers could upload 3D models of tweaked IKEA pieces for companies and individuals to buy them. Here, not only the idea was great, but they had also created a business strategy that made a lot of sense, they knew how to monetise and even produced a video of the project!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one, let’s call it Group B, wanted to revive an abandoned market in the centre of the city. They combined the idea of pop-up events &amp;amp; pop-up stores in such a large and unused space. It took them a while to figure out their target audience, but once they got it, they immediately used it in their logo and landing page, which turned out to be really coherent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Group A and Group B were composed by five or six individuals with very different backgrounds, but gelled in together perfectly with the rest of their respective group’s members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marketing-101&quot;&gt;Marketing 101&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As impossible as it seems, I had to teach a Sales &amp;amp; Marketing 101 under 4 hours, for the morning lesson. I covered inbound, outbound, B2B, B2C, growth hacking, sales hacking, tools I use and practical examples of all the concepts I explained. Oh, and memes. Lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t give a very detailed explanation of any concept unless asked for it. I would rather have them learn a lot of concepts without really drilling down in any of them because their projects were really diverse, and what could be applied in one project might not be valid for the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I gave a workshop on how to create an effective landing page for free in under an hour. I did a live demo of Strikingly, a really cool product for bootstrapping entrepreneurs who want to create a fast and simple landing page for free with no coding skills required. After the workshop, I sat with all of them to help them structure their landing page and / or presentation for the upcoming demo day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if that hadn’t been enough, I was also invited to give an after-work talk – beers involved – about community management. At MarsBased, we organise Startup Grind in Barcelona, where I happen to be the Regional Director for Southern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Startup Grind Barcelona, we interview a leading entrepreneur every month. We’ve been doing it since April 2014 non-stop, hence growing a community of entrepreneurs. Our event, nowadays, garners over 100 people per edition, which is a respectable number, considering that the event is paid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably, this was the funniest part of the day. After 8 hours of intense work, we all chilled out drinking a couple of cold home-brewed beers &amp;amp; talking about community management in a more casual way. I remember I dropped some bombs (I have very blunt opinions about certain topics) which helped spur the group conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I was pleasantly surprised with the project and how efficiently it was run by the MOB crew and, as I mentioned above, more than surprised by the level of the participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have kept in touch with some of them, and look forward to seeing their progress, should they decide to carry on with their projects (especially Group A &amp;amp; B).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you MOB for kicking ass.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Digital Nomad's Guide to Spend 25 Days in Bali and the Gili Islands</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/08/08/A-digital-nomads-guide-to-spend-25-days-in-Bali.html" />

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160808.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160808.png&quot; title=&quot;Canggu Beach, Bali&quot; alt=&quot;Canggu Beach, Bali&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; This is a live blog entry that will be updated almost daily until the end of my trip, on August 29th. It includes a day-to-day description of my stay here that digital nomads, and those who work while they travel, might find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day I included an all-you-need-to-know about a certain topic that is called &lt;em&gt;Things you need to know&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-long-didnt-read&quot;&gt;Too long; didn’t read&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for the TL;DR summary of this guide, it is the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am spending 25 days in Bali and the Gili Islands, Indonesia. I am not doing too many activities because I am working a full-time shift remotely, but I have visited many things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backpackers on a very limited budget.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Couples or people looking for a romantic trip in high-standard hotels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;People 100% on holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is for you if:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to know where can you get work done every day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You know how to have fun when time is limited because of work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to be able to travel around regardless of the two above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You want to get a taste of everything in Indonesia, regardless of the budget and/or prejudices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt;Table of contents&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is not structured per se. I might do that for a second version if there’s enough traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I will link you to the parts that mention the following subjects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;costs&quot;&gt;Costs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have compiled my daily expenses in a downloadable PDF file, so you can see the costs of the restaurants. With the day number and the name of the restaurant, you can browse this post to see the review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-1-arrival--checkin&quot;&gt;Day 1: Arrival &amp;amp; Checkin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might remember from my last blog entry about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/08/07/Tips-for-a-24h-layover-in-Doha-Qatar.html&quot; title=&quot;Tips for a 24h layover in Qatar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;24h layover in Doha&lt;/a&gt;, I flew from Barcelona to Denpasar (capital of Bali, Indonesia) to spend 25 days of mixing work &amp;amp; holidays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Tourist Trap&quot; id=&quot;touristtrap1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a title=&quot;Airport Transfer&quot; id=&quot;airporttransfer&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booked everything last minute, but I thought it would be a great idea to request a transfer from the airport to the hotel (in Canggu) since I was arriving at night and had never been in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it wasn’t entirely bad, I could’ve saved almost 20 USD on getting an Uber right on the spot. My airport-hotel transfer cost 350k rupees, the equivalent of 25 USD, while an Uber would have cost barely 8 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took over an hour and a half to cover barely 40 km because traffic jams are a constant in this island. Most roads are wide enough for a car and a motorbike while some aren’t even fit for the two of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Hotel in Canggu&quot; id=&quot;hotel&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hotel is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/the-kirana-resto-spa.es.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-1FCA4oggJCAlhYSApiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYAQq4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQaSAgF5qAID;sid=624ff78c2e990ef23e0eaf4380e5a893;dcid=5&quot; title=&quot;Kirana Hotel Resto Spa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kirana Hotel Resto Spa&lt;/a&gt;, that might not fit travellers on a budget, but is not as expensive as big resorts. Plus, there are very good Booking.com last minute offers. The hotel is great if you’re looking for a comfortable room, with a pool, breakfast included, 24h service, bikes to rent and other facilities. The downsides are: wifi is everywhere but quite slow, the food is overpriced and the gym hasn’t been maintained since the early 90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once checked-in, I asked the driver to take me to a money exchange, where I changed the equivalent of 200 USD. I never change that much at once, but I decided I’d be spending heavily in buying all my stuff in the first two days, plus I had to pay the transfer twice thus amounting to 50 USD (long story short, I told them I arrived the previous day to my arrival. My mistake.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, then, proceeded to go to the local market to buy some things I did not bring (sunscreen, mosquito repellent, toothpaste &amp;amp; other stuff) &amp;amp; headed out to have dinner right across the street to &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/fika/573825b2498eeae084f50eda&quot; title=&quot;Fika restaurant in Canggu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fika&lt;/a&gt;. While overpriced - I paid almost as much as I’d pay for a dinner in Barcelona - I found it extremely delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wifi password is &lt;em&gt;fikalicious&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Changing money in Canggu&quot; id=&quot;changingmoney&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Changing money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never change money in the airports. Go to the city instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some places will give you different rates according to the note size (for instance: 5 USD at 12000 rupees, 20 USD at 12200, 100 USD at 12900). Keep looking for one with unified prices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only change in places that are facing a main street by daylight. You never know who’s around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Indonesia, they’ll give you a better price for USD than for euro. Check whether changing from euro to USD and then to rupees is worth it and go for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A place whose rates are way better than the majority is probably a scam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never change too much money at once. Change as you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2-exploration&quot;&gt;Day 2: Exploration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After not having rested properly in the previous three nights because of flights and a busy social life in Barcelona, I set out to explore. After all, Sundays are lazy days and I assumed everything would be closed, so I took the chance to explore the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is included at Kirana, so unless otherwise mentioned, you will assume I break my fast every day at the hotel. Hands down, it is a very tasty menu with three options: Continental, American or Indonesian breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strolled around the area to find the basics: restaurants, shops, money exchange, pharmacy and the like. Canggu is a quiet area with a couple of party spots and a coworking space. The latter is great if you like coworking spaces. I do not, and will therefore not use it unless I struggle to find wifi. But so far, most of the wifis I’ve found are stable enough to do Skype calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the roads aren’t paved and they don’t have a sidewalk, so walking around when there’s traffic can be sort of dangerous. At night, one must be really careful, as in addition to aggressive Indonesian drivers there are heaps of drunken idiot tourists driving like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Food in Canggu&quot; id=&quot;food1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to try a new place for lunch and walked 100 meters further to &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/ithaka-warung/53bfe531498e0587976db99c&quot; title=&quot;Ithaka Warung&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ithaka Warung&lt;/a&gt;. Very tasty European-Indonesian fusion and definitely a whole deal cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wifi is also great for working and doing calls, and the password I have forgotten, but they will give it to you gladly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main attractions this side of the island has is the sunset, as we’re on the Southern side of the island. I wanted to see the entire sunset, but it clouded up last minute and that’s some of the pictures I took:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160808sunset3.png&quot; title=&quot;Sunset in Bali&quot; alt=&quot;Sunset in Bali&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160808sunset4.png&quot; title=&quot;Sunset in Bali&quot; alt=&quot;Sunset in Bali&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, I decided to meet some people from the Digital Nomads community &lt;a href=&quot;https://nomadlist.com/&quot; title=&quot;Nomadlist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nomadlist&lt;/a&gt; and we went to grab a bite to &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/old-mans/51b99d4c498e6c14f85f48f1&quot; title=&quot;Old Man's&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Old Man’s&lt;/a&gt; which is good albeit too expensive for the area. This seems to be one of the places of choice to get some drinks as well, but only for tourists. Same as other bars in the area, like Deus Ex Machina, where we found a nice reggae concert and about three million drunk tourists (approx.) on a Sunday night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Walking Around&quot; id=&quot;walkingaround&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Walking around&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No one walks in Canggu or Indonesia per se.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traffic in Canggu is not very intense, but it’s aggressive. Watch out at all times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scooter is the way to go (International driving license required!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of scooters, as some of them have a support on the side for the surf tables that sticks out too much and might hurt you if they’re close enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The streets in Canggu are being paved and have no sidewalk. Some parts are under construction, so mind your steps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re watching Google Maps, streets are not 100% accurate. 90-95% are, but the newer ones might not appear.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The more I walk, the more I get tired of stray dogs. They’re harmless but they bark all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-3-first-working-day&quot;&gt;Day 3: First working day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160808food.png&quot; title=&quot;Indonesian Tapas&quot; alt=&quot;Indonesian Tapas&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Words can't describe how awesome these tapas were.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day of exploration and getting things right, I realised that wifi in the hotel wasn’t working, but it was because I had the Google DNS activated. Once I removed them and accepted the ones set by the DHCP server, I was good to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you did not understand the previous paragraph, you might want to read this: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using&quot; title=&quot;Google DNS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google DNS setup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I got the Internet fixed, I worked on some stuff from the hotel until lunchtime. I went again to Ithaka, like on my first day, to taste the Indonesian tapas and the fruit salad, which were awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am attaching a couple of pictures for you to observe the awesomeness of the food there. These two tapas, plus a drink and a HUGE bowl of fruit salad + yoghurt + honey, roughly 5 USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160808food2.png&quot; title=&quot;Fruit salad&quot; alt=&quot;Fruit salad&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;I believe the BIG fruit salad was for two people. I ate it the same.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it was also a cloudy sunset, I did not even bother going to the beach, so I ventured forth to find another cool spot to try for remote working, and decide to go for a semi-Australian place called &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/little-flinders-cafe/566e444c498ee8c21ec915ec&quot; title=&quot;Little Flinders Café&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Little Flinders&lt;/a&gt;. Tried the tea and the fruit juices and found them good. Wifi was also working fine (password: &lt;em&gt;yourname&lt;/em&gt;) but I found the food very expensive as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, went to have dinner a little bit to the north, and found a shady place where no one was eating called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g608486-d7933968-Reviews-Waroeng_Nonii-Kerobokan_Bali.html&quot; title=&quot;Waroeng Nonii&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Waroeng Nonii&lt;/a&gt; which was OK considering how cheap it was. Don’t expect too much quality for the ridiculous prices. Plus, the wifi was good enough to sustain Skype calls (password: &lt;em&gt;mengkudu&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Beaches and Sunsets&quot; id=&quot;beaches&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Beaches &amp;amp; Sunsets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beaches in Canggu are for surfers. If you’re into surfing, this is the place to be!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These beaches have black sand. You will find no white sand beaches in Canggu.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since this part is facing towards the west, you will enjoy fantastic sunsets here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can walk along the beach, north or south, for kilometres. Enjoy the walk!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easy to spot crabs in the sand. They’re harmless and will run away from you if you get close to them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Canggu beaches are good places to stargaze.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red ants bite hard. Take care!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-4-work-work-work&quot;&gt;Day 4: Work work work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I planned to stuff all my Skype calls of the week in just one day, so I could have more flexibility on the rest of the days of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to play it safe and went to Fika (remember from day 1?) to do them. In between, I had lunch. An amazing salmon gravlax omelette with feta cheese and spinach and a red quinoa fruit salad, which were amazing. The omelette was a tad too salty, but that’s probably my fault. I don’t use salt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings an interesting topic I haven’t covered: healthy food options. Most places, if not all, will offer vegetarian or vegan options. Unlike other Asian countries, where they don’t understand these concepts we occidentals do, here they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also trying to reduce the carbs daily intake to only the necessary, and I find plenty of options to follow this routine. One would think that all dishes have got rice, which is true for the most part, but there are sufficient dishes without neither noodles nor rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About half of the dishes are deep fried, which means your choice is limited if you don’t eat fried stuff, but vegetables and fruit abound in the menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for snacks and appetisers, or smaller meals to satiate the appetite while on the go, fruit juices, smoothies and other power drinks are the best options (and refreshing). Some places even offer protein extra for the juices, shakes and smoothies, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/grocer--grind-echo-beach/5328cdbd498e5c5a261a56b0&quot; title=&quot;Grocer and Grind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Grocer &amp;amp; Grind&lt;/a&gt;. This place has a really good wifi (password: &lt;em&gt;coffeetime&lt;/em&gt;) and sockets all over the place. However, it’s expensive. I paid the equivalent of 6 USD for a smoothie (4 euros, for the Europeans). I’d have paid the same in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, this place is close to Dojo, the coworking space in Canggu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I tried to catch a good sunset for the third time, but it clouded up last moment. I managed to create a cool timelapse video you can see here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LGQ0i8U82jI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I am not concerned about the quality of the wifis, which might have improved a lot in the last couple of years. Everyone told me that I wouldn’t be able to find good wifi on the island. Of course, I’m not downloading terabytes of data, but I have been able to download entire repositories of code and upload videos to Youtube without too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back home, I stumbled a modest Indonesian restaurant, not fancy at all, where I decided I would eat. I ate very good, for a reasonable price, but I haven’t understood what I have eaten (one of the sides smelled really foul, but I assumed it was supposed to smell like that). I can’t find the place on any website, so I suppose they just opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had no wifi and I got stung by so many mosquitos it’s not even funny. Now, we’ll just wait so see who dies first: the mosquitos or me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Eating Healthy&quot; id=&quot;eatinghealthy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Eating healthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can order always healthy options pretty much anywhere (vegan &amp;amp; vegetarian, mostly).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They’re very flexible to alter your order (no rice, noodles instead of rice, extra of this instead of that, etc.) so just ask.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smoothies, power juices and detox drinks are fairly popular in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some places offer extra protein for the smoothies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drink coconut water. It’s quite the experience plus a healthy option that keeps you hydrated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t drink water from the tap. Always bottled mineral water. Don’t put your holidays at risk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you like a place, repeat. 25 days are enough to try new stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to eat out at night, put on some mosquito repellent before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-5-last-day-of-work&quot;&gt;Day 5: Last day of work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am here for 25 days, and today is my last official day working for my company before the holidays break. Since I run my own company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;, I will need to keep an eye on it, and have to take a call every now and then or answer some emails. But for the most part, I am pretty confident that my business partners will take care of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I announced in the beginning, I will spend my days in a mix of learning and travelling. I want to learn new technologies and hone my blogging skills, so I will be spending lots of time with the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the final day of work, I had to take some calls, so I researched some of the best places for wifi. Turns out, I had been in some of them already: Fika and Grocer &amp;amp; Grind, so I went them to work with my buddy Dylan from the Nomadslist community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to venture into another sketchy place for locals for lunch, and turned out to me mediocre at best, but I had lunch for about 5 USD (3 euros) plus they had wifi, so I best not complain. The place is &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/warung-cucu/56c30675cd10904e6d0d13f4&quot; title=&quot;Warung Cucu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warung Cucu&lt;/a&gt; and the wifi password is &lt;em&gt;pastinyaman&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the fourth day in a row, I’ve tried in vain to get a good shot of a sunset but didn’t succeed. It always clouds up last minute!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Working remotely&quot; id=&quot;working&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Working remotely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One can seem to work from pretty much anywhere. No need to pay for a coworking space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wifis are pretty stable, but not all of them. Try a few before settling with one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Almost every place I have been to had available sockets to plug your laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are many remote workers and/or digital nomads around, so the locals are used to see people bumming for a wifi and just drinking a milkshake during the entire afternoon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The area is safe enough to leave your laptop unattended while you go to the toilet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Ubud&quot; id=&quot;ubud&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-6-ubud&quot;&gt;Day 6: Ubud&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I arranged to meet some friends at Seminyak to go together to Ubud. Turns out, from Canggu you cannot get an Uber because it’s too far away from their operating area, so I had to go with the hotel’s private driver. You can Uber to there, but not from there. A private driver is an expensive option and not recommendable at all, but at 8am no taxis are around. Even less so in the area I’m staying in, far from main roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though on Google Maps said it’s an hour by car, the journey took almost three hours because of the traffic. Traffic is a huge issue on the island, so always plan your car rides with plenty of time, lest you lose a flight or other activities you might have arranged. We actually missed a local dancing celebration we wanted to see because of the traffic. That happened only between 9 and 10am and we arrived 10 minutes before it ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way, we stopped to check some tourist traps, like a traditional Balinese clothing factory, a particularly a-priori-displeasing coffee place, a silver factory and an allegedly famous place for their pork ribs. We did not like any of them, so you’re better off ignoring them if you’re not into this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so you have more information, I will describe the places a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Tourist Trap&quot; id=&quot;touristtrap2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clothing-factory---bali-bidadari-batik&quot;&gt;Clothing factory - Bali Bidadari Batik&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is on the opposite coast to Canggu. As soon as you arrive you’re faced with a bunch of women working by the front porch of a big building, and a swarm of tour guides will approach you to take you around and explain the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tour is done, they will take you to the shop. The clothes seemed to be as expensive as you’d find them in the main cities of Europe. Luckily enough, not a single of them seemed to match my taste, so I bought none. Some illustrative prices: men’s shirt 35-40 USD, ties 15-20 USD, shorts 20-25 USD. Sorry, ladies, didn’t check the prices for women’s wears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-coffee-place---taman-ayu-luwak-coffee&quot;&gt;The coffee place - Taman Ayu Luwak Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, one of the traditional things in Bali is a kind of coffee that has been basically &lt;em&gt;digested&lt;/em&gt; by an animal. The poor little thing eats the sweet coffee beans, and then it poops them. The local Balinese people extract the beans from the dry shit, boil them (to eliminate bacteria - thank god!) and then produce the coffee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not like coffee, but that one seemed to please my palate just enough not to pull a funny face, as I do with black coffee. It’s not bitter at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the price of the coffee (50k rupees - about 5 USD) we were offered a selection of local coffees, teas and cacaos. About twelve of them, most of which were good - probably due to the high amount of sugar they contained. However, that was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albeit a touristic trap again, I enjoyed the place, as I could see the aforementioned animals, walked through the jungle, and got to see many plants I had never seen in real life, like cinnamon, lemongrass, vanilla and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you’re into responsible tourism, you should probably not do this. I did so I could say I have drunk something that’s been shat by someone/something else. Off the bucket list, but I’m not entirely proud of condoning this cruel practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend that you do this activity if that’s OK with your beliefs, though. Check it here &lt;a href=&quot;http://tamanayuluwakcoffee.com/index.php/kopi-luwak-probiotik.html&quot; title=&quot;Taman Ayu Luwak Coffee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taman Ayu Luwak Coffee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Tourist Trap&quot; id=&quot;touristtrap3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silver-factory---indarti-silver&quot;&gt;Silver factory - Indarti Silver&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same as the silk factory, another huge tourist trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know next to nothing about silver ornaments such as rings, pendants, or necklaces. Thus, I can’t really relate to how different are prices compared to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I can tell you that they will offer you a base 10% discount for the piece. As opposed to other places, where you pay according to weight in grammes, here you pay for pieces, and most of the pieces - if not all - seemed to have a 92.5% of silver. I suppose that is good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re good negotiating, you can get heavy discounts down to almost 50%. I have seen it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all I can tell you about this place. I would definitely not recommend it, but each one to his own. Here’s the site: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indartisilverbali.com/&quot; title=&quot;Indarti Silver&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Indarti Silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bbq-place&quot;&gt;BBQ place&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Tourist Trap&quot; id=&quot;touristtrap4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t write down the name of this place. Never mind: it was not very great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a big restaurant close to nature, like any auto grill you’d find on a regular highway. Nothing remarkable, just very convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food was nice enough, and we ended up paying 10 USD per person, but it was nothing to write home about. Grilled meat is their speciality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are probably a million places better than this one and much cheaper, so try to avoid places like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why we stopped in the aforementioned places is because my buddies had agreed to do this daily trip on their way to Ubud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will explain how these things work because they didn’t seem to know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most private drivers, agencies, bus drivers, and the like, have an agreement with these places. They will always bring tourist to these places and they will get a commission. Depending on the country or the area, they get a fix commission for every group they bring, plus a percentage of how much you spend there. Business is business they say. Not complaining here, just describing it for your information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to topic, once in Ubud, we went to the Monkey Temple. Another rather touristic attraction, but I really enjoyed it, as I got a taste of the real jungle, saw some beautiful nature and interacted with monkeys (REAL monkeys - not utterly incompetent people) for the first time in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entrance fee: 50k rupees. No wifi. Just kidding about the wifi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole thing takes about an hour to see, or two if you’re Australian and like to prank the monkeys, or Japanese and stop to take pictures every two steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of sheer curiosity, I fired up Pokémon Go to see if I would get special stuff there, but the game is not that intelligent. No Mankeys, much to my dismay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of the day. Negotiated a price to drive me back to the hotel, and ended up paying an insane 400k rupees (35 USD). I guess I could’ve found something cheaper, but the guy was nice enough, had a good car and let me play my music loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set out to try a new place for dinner, as after almost two hours in the car I was starving. I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g311298-d10148132-Reviews-Gypsy-Canggu_Bali.html&quot; title=&quot;Gypsy Bali&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GYPSY Bali&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is conveniently located close to many interesting things: a temple, the coworking space (Dojo), my hotel, the beach and many other cool bars. The food was great yet a bit overpriced. I ended up paying for two dishes and a fruit juice 236k rupees (22 USD give or take), which is the most expensive meal I’ve eaten in Bali by far. The staff were nice enough and they had a really stable &amp;amp; fast wifi, so it paid off, but I will not repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, the wifi password is &lt;em&gt;gypsybali&lt;/em&gt;. Quite an imagination!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Prices&quot; id=&quot;prices&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Prices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All prices are shown as 50, 70, 120, but need to be added the thousands, as rupees work like that. Example: an espresso might cost 30000 rupees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most places include service tax &amp;amp; official taxes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All places in Canggu are obliged to give a receipt. If they refuse to give it, you can have your stuff for free. This is not so on the islands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it looks like a tourist trap, it’s definitely a tourist trap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it does not look like a tourist trap but it’s in a touristic area, it’s a tourist trap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pretty much everywhere, negotiation is a skill that comes in very handy. Never take the first price if it’s not written anywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restaurants close to high-standard hotels are pricey as fkuc. Walk a little more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Likewise, walk away from touristic attractions to see prices drop heavily.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eating cheap does not necessarily mean it’ll taste better. Works exactly for expensive places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-7-wandering-around&quot;&gt;Day 7: Wandering around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It rained during the night, and the forecast for today was rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided I would go around walking to check the area. I’m that kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the things I want to visit in the Canggu / Seminyak area, only two are within walking distance: the La Laguna beach bar and the W Spa jungle-like entrance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ventured into the Balinese crazy roads by foot, which is actually rather dangerous. No one walks around in Bali. Everyone takes the scooter or the car. There aren’t even bicycles around. I was the centre of everyone’s attention while I walked an adrenaline-boosting dangerous road of almost 5km.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perfect timing, I arrived at La Laguna when it started to pour down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/la-laguna/55990d1b498e844b2946e679&quot; title=&quot;La laguna beach bar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;La Laguna&lt;/a&gt; is a beach bar that is very nicely decorated with old waggons and cartwheels. The prices are expensive, but they have good wifi, and they were most attentive. It was worth the walk. Too bad we had the dullest day outside and could not take good shots of the sea. I remained there until the rain stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to it, lay the &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/w-retreat--spa-bali--seminyak/4d0833c94adb3704249ffb54/photos&quot; target=&quot;W Retreat Spa&quot;&gt; W Retreat &amp;amp; Spa&lt;/a&gt;, famous for its junglesque entrance, worth many pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I must admit my defeat. On my way to W, I got struck by the heaviest rain I’ve seen in a while and had to look for shelter. I tried looking around the W building but found no entrance. It is a huge building and I arrived through the beach. I assumed that entrance must be from the road, which was rather far away. So I withdrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, I chose to walk the beach, which was not only shorter by a million times safer. Why does Google map not accept that people can actually walk on sand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was pouring the fuck down, I got rained on the entire way back home. Luckily enough, I had a raincoat with me that I used for the first time since I bought it ten years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped for lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/caf%C3%A9-canggu/4c37efb693db0f478bd52092&quot; title=&quot;Cafe Canggu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cafe Canggu&lt;/a&gt;, just beneath the Old Man’s Beach Bar. Nice surprise: Cafe Canggu served very good food at one fraction of Old Man’s. I had an entire meal, with a drink and dessert for 75k rupees, which is what you’d pay for a smoothie at Old Man’s, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wifi password: &lt;em&gt;bananajus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another nice place I’ve found, later for dinner, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/warung-bu-mi/4ea668cfd3e35f3cd51943e0&quot; title=&quot;Warung Bu Mi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warung Bu Mi&lt;/a&gt;. They serve pre-cooked food for ridiculous prices. I had an enormous dish of mixed meats &amp;amp; vegetables and a mineral water for 37k rupees (3 USD, 2.5 euros).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, the food might not be warm and they have no wifi, but it’s a really good place to go if you’re on a budget. You’re welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Weather&quot; id=&quot;weather&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key lessons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pack a raincoat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the monsoon hits, it hits hard. However, it does not last for long.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had a little bit of rain in 70% of my days in Bali. Not a single drop on the islands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never trust the weather forecast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weather changes multiple times a day, so you better make the best out of it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even if it rains, temperatures do not drop, so no need to pack for winter clothes/accessories.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring a torch as well. Sunset in August is at 6-6.30PM and most streets don’t have sufficient lighting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Temperatures are pretty constant. I had between 25-30 degrees every single day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-8-full-relax&quot;&gt;Day 8: Full relax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked the weather forecast the night before, and it was rain the entire day. Thus, I planned to stay in the hotel for a full day of relaxing and catching up with stuff like email, or those chores you always put off indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it has not rained at all. My entire day has consisted in relaxing at the hotel’s pool and planning the next steps of my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An alternative to staying in, if you’re on the lookout for something great, you can go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bali-indonesia.com/magazine/bali-must-see-temples.htm&quot; title=&quot;Famous Temples in Bali&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tanah Lot and Uluwatu temples&lt;/a&gt;. They’re kind of far apart from each other. In the morning, you go to Tanah Lot to watch the sunrise, and in the afternoon to the other one to watch the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Nightlife&quot; id=&quot;nightlife&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Nightlife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a metalhead, I find the parties to be too commercial &amp;amp; mainstream. Others might enjoy it!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are plenty of bars with live music everywhere I go, both in Bali and on the Gili islands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Most concerts end at about 11PM, in Bali and in Gili Trawangan. In the other small islands, at about 9 or 9.30 tops.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some restaurants have different prices for dinner (more expensive) and lunch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Foursquare is a little useless down here. Most places are new and don’t have enough reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gili Trawangan is so touristic that you can eat food at pretty much any time of the night. Past 2am only a couple of places remain open, but one does not need to hurry to get food before 9PM lest everything closes as in many countries.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FC Barcelona matches in Gili Trawangan? Go to Warung Warna.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walking around at night is even more dangerous than by day. Drunken motorised idiots everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have not had any single incident in my whole stay, but I’ve read that down in Kuta and Denpasar, some local gangs can get you into trouble or pickpocket you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-9-full-relax&quot;&gt;Day 9: Full relax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same as the previous day, but I decided to plan the next days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Moving Around&quot; id=&quot;movingaround&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to go to Tanah Lot temple, but I could not get hold of any taxi that would get me there. Later I have found that some areas of the island, taxis, ubers and the like can operate in a very limited way. In these limited areas, they can only drop off people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been recommended to use this company (from Asturias, Spain) called &lt;a href=&quot;https://routive.com/&quot; title=&quot;Routive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;which allows you to hire private drivers on demand&lt;/a&gt;. Kinda like Uber but without being Uber, so they’re not yet banned. I haven’t tested it myself, but I’ve been told it’s great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if you’re in one of these areas, your only way to move around is to have the hotel personnel call a private driver for you, which is more expensive than finding it yourself, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, if Uber operates where you are, do use it. It is ridiculously cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the day learning &lt;a href=&quot;http://gulpjs.com/&quot; title=&quot;Gulp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gulp&lt;/a&gt; in order to make this website faster. Because I have been on a developing binge, I haven’t done any sightseeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Food in Canggu&quot; id=&quot;food2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I checked &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; new places! Another cheap pick-your-own-food just next door to my hotel, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/warung-varuna/51110f7ce4b0fd0f2a4b87f1&quot; title=&quot;Warung Varuna&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warung Varuna&lt;/a&gt; (wifi password: &lt;em&gt;makara12&lt;/em&gt;). As opposed to the one I ate on the sixth day, this one’s good and the food was kinda warm. Plus, it didn’t give me any side effects on the next day! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/betelnut-cafe/50331f18e4b0ee26f2777f21&quot; title=&quot;Betelnut Cafe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Betelnut Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, as it is one of the best-rated places on Foursquare. I could see why: the place is really lively, the selection of food &amp;amp; drinks is great and it’s a cool place to work from. It’s got plenty of sockets and the wifi holds well enough. The password is &lt;em&gt;batubolong&lt;/em&gt;. I definitely recommend their power smoothies to recharge batteries! I did not order food, but looked great (although not at local price).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Pizza in Canggu&quot; id=&quot;food3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/pizza-house/50129e3de4b0649cc12070e1&quot; title=&quot;Pizza House&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pizza House&lt;/a&gt;. I had been passing by all these days, and it always looked lively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder: the pizza is really good (it was full of Italians, to prove it!) and they have live concerts every night. The band played some rock &amp;amp; reggae versions (Santana, Marley, Eagles, etc.) and they were quite skilled. I definitely enjoyed both the pizza and the concert. Ah, the wifi was not very fast, but here’s the password: &lt;em&gt;07232016&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices are ok-ish. Somewhere between local &amp;amp; tourist price. However, it’s well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Drugs&quot; id=&quot;drugs&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drugs are strictly prohibited in Indonesia, and they’re really serious about that, especially in Bali.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They seem to be really concerned about cocaine and weed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alcohol is ok, and they have their national beer (Bintang).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the Muslim part of the country, it is strongly advised not to drink outside of bars, especially in underserved areas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the Gili islands, though, since there is no police, drugs abound.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some cafes and bars sell mushrooms, and it seems the thing to do around here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No, I haven’t checked the prices: I don’t do drugs alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Seminyak&quot; id=&quot;seminyak&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a title=&quot;Aria Villa&quot; id=&quot;aria&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-10-seminyak&quot;&gt;Day 10: Seminyak!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to move forward and leave Canggu behind. I feel like I’ve been two days too much. Not that I go very far, but I wanted to see a different part of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the calm &amp;amp; chill Canggu, Seminyak is fully touristic. Prices go up accordingly and there’s way more traffic. This area looks lively, and taxi drivers (they can operate fully here) are very aggressive and won’t stop honking at you if they see you walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a very good deal at &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/aria-luxury-villas--spa/4c2f546916adc9288b4ebd9c&quot; title=&quot;Aria Luxury Villa&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aria Villa&lt;/a&gt; for a night (my mistake, I thought I had booked for two!). I have spent a day in an amazing villa, close to the beach, with private pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been walking around the area and looks like there’s everything around, but I had work to do and couldn’t see much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve had lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/the-fat-turtle/5466bb67498e5ae11a6205e0&quot; title=&quot;The Fat Turtle&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Fat Turtle&lt;/a&gt;, which I think it deserves a better ranking on Foursquare. At 7.9 out of 10 does not do any justice at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is cosy, the food is &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; good and the personnel are very charming. I had a very nice meal for about 10 USD and worked from there for a couple hours (wifi password: &lt;em&gt;redvelvet&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, I explored Foursquare once again, only to be overtaken by an uncontrollable craving for Japanese food. I went to &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/rayjin-teppanyaki/51498b11e4b008ba35f15af0&quot; title=&quot;Rayjin Teppanyaki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rayjin Teppanyaki&lt;/a&gt; and had a nice meal including one of the best tuna tartares I have ever tasted and a plate of king prawns: absolutely delicious. The place, however, is classy yet very loud (the crew chant and sing and toast all the time), so you might get a headache as well. However, the place is well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the hotel, I booked my stay for my next stop: Gili Gede. One of the most remote &amp;amp; non-touristic islands out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Travelling on a budget&quot; id=&quot;budget&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Travelling on a budget&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indonesia is a country where you can really travel around for super cheap. Always ask for discounts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick-your-own-food Warungs are the place to go or food markets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to play Russian roulette, you can also save some bucks eating at food stands in the street.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always negotiate the price with taxi and private drivers. One easy trick to negotiating a fair price from A to B is saying “I came from B to A yesterday for half the price”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Travel agencies (for boat tickets) will always say different prices. Try going to at least five of them before buying the ticket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk away from crowded and touristic areas and try to find out where the locals eat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As for accommodation, book everything on the spot. Go around and ask. Avoid Booking.com or AirBnB.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Avoid ordering starters. Main courses are usually big enough to satiate any appetite.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If any hotel or guesthouse &lt;em&gt;gives you&lt;/em&gt; (i.e: not for shared usage) soap, toilet paper and/or other personal hygiene items, you might want to take them with you. Most places don’t give them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some backpackers and budget travellers use the snorkelling trips to jump from island to island. This, like all things in Indonesia, can be negotiated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Amasya Villa&quot; id=&quot;amasya&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-11-seminyak-with-friends&quot;&gt;Day 11: Seminyak with friends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to book another night in a Villa, as I knew I had some friends in town and wanted to enjoy another night of good sleep before going to the Gili islands, where the quality of the lodging is way lower than on Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/the-amasya.es.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQKoAgM;sid=76e78050834ad7cc18372e4fc9dd0da8&quot; title=&quot;Amasya Villas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Amasya Villa&lt;/a&gt; also through Booking.com. The villa was also nice, but the wifi wasn’t working for shit. I could not even log in from anywhere in the venue. Check some pictures here (Coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lunch, I went to a grill place called &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/chandi/4c067882761ac9b66cf92074&quot; title=&quot;Chandi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chandi&lt;/a&gt;, and ate a marvellous seafood &amp;amp; fish grill platter for about 12 USD (10 euros). The food was really great and well worth its price. Also, the wifi seemed to work great as I streamed a couple of John Oliver’s videos (password: &lt;em&gt;chandi72&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we took a walk along the beach down to Bali Beach and wrapped up the day at &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/mano-seaside-beach-club/50dc278fe4b050d7bbc6b5b1&quot; title=&quot;Mano Seaside&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mano Seaside Beach Club&lt;/a&gt; watching the sunset. The bar was nice enough, I really recommend it: tasty food, a vast selection of healthy drinks and fair prices. Oh, the wifi wasn’t anything to write home about, but it served to upload the Instagram picture of the sunset (password: &lt;em&gt;sunset2016&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, since some of my friends were on a budget, we decided to go for the real Balinese experience and have dinner in the outskirts of town. We walked about 20-25 minutes in the opposite direction to the centre and found a place called &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/warung-bunana/5232eae4498eb9c4804e8aa8&quot; title=&quot;Warung Bunana&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warung Bunana&lt;/a&gt;, filled only with locals. The selection wasn’t especially diverse, but the food was nice enough. We paid not even 2 USD (1.5 euros) per person for a couple of dishes per person and a drink. No wifi here and they hardly spoke English. But, hey, can’t complain for this price!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Pokémon Go&quot; id=&quot;pokemon&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Pokémon Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cities in Bali are quite crowded with pokéstops and gyms, and also with wild pokémon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Islands lack all of these. In compensation, wild Pokémon tend to be rarer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plenty of Electric-type Pokémon, especially Magnemites and Voltorbs. I rarely get any in Barcelona.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since you’re going to walk around a lot, use it to hatch eggs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bali is all around excellent to play. Gili Trawangan is good. Gili Meno &amp;amp; Air are not enough, and Gili Gede is just deficient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Trawangan&quot; id=&quot;gilit&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-12-off-to-the-gili-islands&quot;&gt;Day 12: Off to the Gili Islands&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day before I arranged my trip to Gili Gede with the Villa I was staying in. They were kind enough to arrange my transfer to the port plus the fast boat ticket for a mere 650k rupees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the fast boat from Bali to Gili Gede was already full for the next day, they arranged a fast boat from Bali to Gili Trawangan and then one from there to Gili Gede.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I got lied to, as they assured me that, on my arrival to Gili Trawangan I would be taken to Gili Gede on a fast boat that I never found when I arrived there. The guys at the local office told me this boat never existed, as the last one leaves at 11.30 in the morning, exactly my time of departure from Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some insider’s tips for the boat transfer that you definitely need to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;book only through your hotel of local agencies&lt;/strong&gt;. No sketchy places hidden around corners. I know you know this, but just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, &lt;strong&gt;book with enough time in advance&lt;/strong&gt;. A couple of days might suffice, but it might not. One day is almost never enough. Even less so if travelling to a destination different than Gili Trawangan (where everyone goes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, &lt;strong&gt;don’t schedule stuff for after the boat&lt;/strong&gt;. The departure time is never respected. My boat was supposed to leave at 12.30 and we left at 14.30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you will be waiting under the sun with shittonnes of strangers without a clue of whether &lt;em&gt;that one&lt;/em&gt; is your boat or not. Be alert at all times and try to place yourself at the beginning of the queue at whatever cost necessary. I might have stayed in Bali if I hadn’t done that and got noticed by one of the workers there that saw my sticker and urged me to board (yes, you’re tagged with stickers of different colours according to the company you booked your trip with and your destination).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that, bring plenty of water and food. The trip is not long (one hour and a half, briefly), but the wait can be very long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once there, you will be tempted to travel on the rooftop of the boat. However, take into consideration that abovedecks the sun will be scorching hot, whereas belowdecks you won’t get sunburnt and if you’re lucky you’ll have either AC or a fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you are wearing sneakers or shoes, have your flip-flops at hand, for once you arrive in Gili you will be required to get off the boat in the beach, thus in water &amp;amp; sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, you also brought a suitcase like I did? I am sorry: Gili Trawangan isn’t very suited for suitcases (see what I did there?), so hopefully your hotel, bungalow or homestay will have a transfer or will send someone to fetch your luggage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there was no boat for me until tomorrow, I had to book something last minute and I booked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/bukit-bungalow-karisma.es.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQKoAgM;sid=76e78050834ad7cc18372e4fc9dd0da8&quot; title=&quot;Bukit Kharisma Bungalow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bukit Kharisma Bungalow&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a bungalow in a quiet part of town (read: dark &amp;amp; unkempt) but the personnel are really nice. The place is quite barebones and not classy at all, but I really didn’t want to pay much, considering I am waking up early tomorrow to get my boat to Gili Gede.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Gili Trawangan, you do not want to miss the sunset. Walk southwards to the Sunset Point. It’s gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last tips for the day: go to eat dinner in the market. You can get stuffed for a mere 20k rupees, plus the food is great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are bars aplenty to go out and have drinks. Not quite my style, but looks like you can heaps of fun if you’re with the right company. It is very touristic here, but the mood around is much better than in Seminyak. I am enjoying it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Travelling by boat&quot; id=&quot;boat&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Travelling by boat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The boat trip will take you all day long. Don’t plan anything for the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring provisions for the day, as it can be a long one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will feel disoriented due to the lack of information. Because Bali.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The boat stops in Gili Air first, then goes to Gili Trawangan. Just so you know it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They might tell you to stay on top, but you want to go belowdecks where there’s a fan and you won’t be frying.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the sea is not calm, you might experience sea sickness. There are medicines on board, but you should bring your own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Gede&quot; id=&quot;giligede&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-13-cockroaches&quot;&gt;Day 13: Cockroaches!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an insomniac, waking up after all the difficulties I have to catch sleep is quite a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more so if you wake up because a cockroach is gnawing at your fingers. This rather unpleasant surprise almost screwed up my night. When I went after the roach, I discovered the many insects in the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I smashed the roach, the toilet was full of ants, marching &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt; all around the bathroom. I had to borrow the anti-bug spray and then pump water all over the room to wash away the dead bodies. Leave no trace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you did not like this part of the story, rest assured: neither did I. Do not rent that place. Also, wifi did not work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the bug catching, I slept a few hours more and had breakfast (included), which was a cup of tea and a nice vegetarian omelette with toasts. The omelette was good, truth be told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I set out to the port to leave for Gili Gede (finally). I was there on time and needed not to wait. There were very few of us, and the boat was considerably smaller than the one taking us to Gili Trawangan. In fact, the trip was short, with one stopover in the Senggigi port in Lombok.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paid 450k rupees for the fast boat, which is kind of expensive, but well worth it. In just one hour I arrived ashore. Gili Gede is beautiful from afar. More than from close, as I will disclose in the next lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island is one of the non-touristic southern Gilis (as a matter of fact, &lt;em&gt;Gili&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;small island&lt;/em&gt;). It’s inhabited mostly by fishermen and pearl collectors. It is a working island: no tourists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking around you will come across some villages. Try not to hang around in swimwear to pay them some respect. Also, children in the villages will follow you around and say &lt;em&gt;hello&lt;/em&gt;. Be kind to them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gili Gede is also a Muslim island, much like the northern Gilis. This means that you will hear a mosque at pretty much every hour of the day and certain hours of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most recent years, the island has seen some bungalows and hotels settle in the island, but it’s light years away from being a tourist attraction. The island itself has got nothing to see. You can walk around it in the span of 4 hours, but it’s dirty and unkept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say that the most beautiful beaches are up north, but my hotel lay far south. I walked up to one hour and didn’t find any beach worth mentioning. To summarise my stay in Gili Gede: the snorkel trip was cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Gede Accommodation&quot; id=&quot;giligedehotels&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accommodation&quot;&gt;Accommodation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed at Secret Island Resort (one star by Booking.com, two by the owner’s opinion), which is a very rustic place in the southernmost part of the island. Reachable by boat from the main and only port (in front of Kokomo Resort) with a private boat for 75k rupees and a 10 minutes boat trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is charming, yet not for all kinds of travellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/secret-island-resort.es.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQKoAgM;sid=76e78050834ad7cc18372e4fc9dd0da8&quot; title=&quot;Secret Island Resort&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Secret Island&lt;/a&gt; sits atop of a hill, with many steps, which is not suitable for suitcases. It’s got no electricity between 5AM and 5PM, and the wifi is laughable. Actually, it is not only super weak, but it’s got a daily quota.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true Indonesian experience continued when I was shown to my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The room consisted in a log cabin in the middle of nature, with not a single window that could be closed and no equipment whatsoever save for the bed and the mosquito net (I am most thankful for these two!). The bathroom featured a salt water shower and a bucket of non-salt water to rinse off the shower gel. The sink was hard to look at and didn’t almost have water (depended on the day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To top it off, the wood would creak and crack with every step I took inside there. Now, that’s solitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the bright side, however, I got to experience true peace over there: no sounds but nature, a most beautiful view of the sea that allowed me to see kickass sunsets and much to my surprise, I found no insects within the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing about Secret Island, however, is its owner Peter, the nicest American expat ever, and the main room where the food was served. The main room had also a pool table, musical equipment (Peter and I jammed guitar and harmonica for almost three hours one evening!) and board games. Everyone hung out there until 10PM, eating, drinking a cold one, and playing pool before calling it a night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in call, one can’t complain for the price he paid. It was truly memorable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatives to Secret Island? There are some bungalows scattered around the island, but I could not find them on any major booking site. However, my perception is that Secret Island is the cheapest place to stay (around 30 USD a night).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re splurging, you might want to check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booking.com/hotel/id/kokomo-resort-gili-gede.en-gb.html?aid=311984;label=kokomo-resort-gili-gede-5AzN3GLFugKK6CYRRawwhwS90583967892%3Apl%3Ata%3Ap1%3Ap2%3Aac%3Aap1t3%3Aneg%3Afi%3Atikwd-235273272327%3Alp20445%3Ali%3Adec%3Adm;sid=76e78050834ad7cc18372e4fc9dd0da8;ucfs=1;room1=A,A;dest_type=city;dest_id=-2691914;srfid=e3a28637428a4de578af5389d988988a85283b77X1;highlight_room=&quot; title=&quot;Kokomo Resort&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kokomo Resort&lt;/a&gt;, a four-stars resort in the middle of the island. As mentioned above, right in front of the port. That one is about 400 USD a night, though, but the venue and its facilities seem to deliver, as I discovered one time I went there to scrap some wifi to book my next stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Gede Activities&quot; id=&quot;giligedeactivities&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;activities&quot;&gt;Activities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might have imagined, there’s not much to do on this island besides walking and doing the snorkelling trips. For a mere 12 USD, I was able to do it on my next day. Details later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Kokomo, the price went really up for, I guess, the very same trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s wrap this day with the key lessons learnt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Dating and Hanging Out&quot; id=&quot;dating&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Dating apps &amp;amp; hanging out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bali, the Gili islands, and Indonesia in general, is a very touristic area. Lots of people passing means lots of people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Although some parts are definitely for couples (the smaller Gilis), in Bali and in Gili Trawangan you will come across many singles and lone travellers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dating apps aren’t banned in this country, so you can use pretty much all of them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have met the most people by using Tinder. The rest of apps didn’t report many people around.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Distance measuring (most of these apps use distance to find new people) is tricky when you’re on an island. You don’t want to get people from nearby islands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Tinder, you will find way too many &lt;em&gt;not free&lt;/em&gt; girls. Some of them have it written on their profiles. Some don’t. In case of doubt, swipe left. Unless, that is, you actually want to pay for that (not judging here!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-14-snorkelling-in-gili-gede&quot;&gt;Day 14: Snorkelling in Gili Gede&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarm went off at 8am to break our fast on scrambled eggs with toast &amp;amp; ginger tea. That would serve for the upcoming snorkel trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, I took a snorkel trip with 4 other people from Secret Island that took us around Gili Gede, Gili Layar and another island I can’t remember the name of. The trip lasted for almost 4 hours (we then stopped at Layar to have lunch) and was really worth it. Although we did not get to see any turtle, the underwater landscape was very rich and - I guess - most virgin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonnes of coral, fishes of sizes and colours I had never seen, crabs &amp;amp; other sea creatures made my day. As the water is very shallow in these tide-ridden beaches, the boat would stop at about 50 meters from the shore. Just so you know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at Secret Island, I decided to walk up to Kokomo Resort to bum some of their internet off and book my next stay. I also ate a magnificent fruit salad platter and drank a young coconut for 100k rupees (expensive for local standards, but damn well worth it). That, and buying the ticket back to Gili Trawangan, earned me the right to take a swim in their swimming pool, which I diligently accepted and obliged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried wandering around the island in many other places and have found it dirtier and uglier. Definitely, not worth coming down here, unless you want a real disconnection from the world. I don’t regret my decision of going to Gili Gede. It was a true experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The walk back made me miss the sunset by about ten minutes because we were walking on the opposite site of the island to where the sun sets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come dinner time, I took the guitar and started jamming some of my favourite tunes. It was a really nice acoustic Yamaha guitar, almost perfectly tuned and not very used. Allegedly, there’s a guitar maker in Bali, in Canggu, that you should visit if you’re looking for nice guitars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The jam went on for almost three hours when Peter joined me with his harmonica and started singing some bluesy songs (full disclosure: I’m a mediocre player, at best. All I know is chords) whose lyrics he completely improvised. That was a fun night, topped off with a couple of games of billiards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way. Geckos are freaking HUGE in this island. If you’ve got them in your cabin’s walls, that’s both a blessing and a curse. They will eat all the insects, but they drop poo everywhere. I take gecko poo any day over cockroaches and spiders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Snorkelling&quot; id=&quot;snorkeling&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Snorkelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone, literally, offers snorkelling trips. Negotiate your way around them before picking one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use tonnes of sunscreen in your back before going snorkelling. Else, you’ll burn it badly. The sun burns like a bitch down here in Indonesia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No need to pack your snorkelling equipment (glasses and fins) as everyone offers them for rental and they’re decent enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The smaller the group, the better, as the boat will be less crowded and you’ll have more interaction with the driver / instructor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nothing to fear out there: no sharks or deadly animals out there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just don’t touch animals, some of them might be poisonous.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have only seen jellyfish one day, and I’ve snorkelled pretty much every day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t step on or break coral.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Underwater bags, where have you been all my life?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As soon as I go back to Barcelona, I’m buying a GoPro.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You don’t need to go on paid trips to see turtles in Gili Trawangan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Bali Belly&quot; id=&quot;balibelly&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Trawangan 2&quot; id=&quot;gilit2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-15-bally-belly--back-to-gili-trawangan&quot;&gt;Day 15: Bally belly &amp;amp; Back to Gili Trawangan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After exactly fifteen days, the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/travellers-diarrhoea&quot; title=&quot;Bali belly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bali belly&lt;/a&gt; got me alas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;traveller’s diarrhoea&lt;/em&gt; and a bunch of other bizarre names, it is a good way to screw up your trip. Long story short, it makes you use the privy every two minutes and usually goes away after four days. Luckily enough, I’ve got a strong stomach and that didn’t make me lose my appetite (thus not getting dehydrated or malnourished) and a handful of medicines for the treatment. Yet I could not find the medicines until I arrived at Gili T.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That kept me up for most of the night, so you can imagine that I didn’t really look forward to taking a couple of boats the next day. But I eventually collapsed, exhausted as I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to run and tell the private boat driver to speed the fuck up to reach the Kokomo port in time, as he arrived 20 minutes late to pick me up and I almost missed my fast boat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left Gili Gede behind happy to have enjoyed it, and dead sure that I won’t recommend it to anyone. Too much trouble to find it and it does not pay off, in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in Gili Trawangan, I went straight to my new temporary home. I had booked two nights at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/gili-garden.es.html?aid=304142;label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQKoAgM;sid=76e78050834ad7cc18372e4fc9dd0da8;ucfs=1;room1=A,A;dest_type=city;dest_id=900048659;srfid=316c77bd2ac9b0a891e2a9cc6e722977f08abe9aX1;highlight_room=&quot; title=&quot;Gili Garden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gili Garden&lt;/a&gt;, just to make sure I visited Gili Trawangan properly while I pondered the option of bouncing to Gili Air or Gili Meno. Both of which had been recommended very positively to me in the previous days to my arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gili Garden is expensive for its worth. The best thing is that it has got AC, but the rest is really basic. However, a step up in comparison to where I come from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The personnel are super nice, and one of them happens to play guitar very beautifully all day long. I really enjoyed listening to his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, it seems to me that because this place is buried deep within the city (6-7 blocks from the beach), it actually stands in the middle of a very poor region. Much like I found it to be with my previous accommodation in Gili T, this place had also insects galore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon entering the room for the first time I found a spider. Not larger than 3-4 centimetres, but that was just the beginning. Then a couple of cockroaches followed, yet none of them woke me up at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, I did sleep like a baby, indeed, both nights. Perhaps it was the Bali belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the day in the room, researching my next destination, and decided to go for Gili Meno. I had a day and a half to explore Gili T, then. The wifi here really sucked and couldn’t get much done (password: &lt;em&gt;garden098&lt;/em&gt;). But with the mobile data, I got all the required information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gathered some strength to go out to the supermarket and buy some liquid yoghurt (works like a charm to recover your intestinal bacteria) and found I could actually stay out for almost an hour. Since I had a couple of friends in town, I set out to watch the sunset with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went again to Sunset Point, to a beach bar called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664666-d10454732-Reviews-Malibu_Beach_Club-Gili_Trawangan_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html&quot; title=&quot;Malibu Beach Bar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Malibú&lt;/a&gt;, where I drank a fruit juice to regain vitamins. The sunset was really cool, but then again, cloudy as usual. After that, we went to the Night Market to eat dinner and get an ice-cream from the famous &lt;em&gt;always-copied-never-matched&lt;/em&gt; Gili Gelato (there are many around town). Well worth the price (25k for a single scoop, 35k for double).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also hopped from bar to bar until we decided not a single of them was to our liking. All of them were too loud and full of drunken tourists, while we were shooting for a laid-back live music experience. Because it was late, all of them had ended. However, all day long Gili Trawangan offers a very good selection of live concerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my football (Americans read &lt;em&gt;soccer&lt;/em&gt;) team, FC Barcelona, was playing the opening game of the new season at midnight, I stayed in a bar to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coolest thing happened just then: they were actually closing and wouldn’t serve me, but they told me to stay to watch the match. A few of them sat with me for the first half of the game, and we actually chatted about football and politics, which I found cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come the second half, and unbeknownst to me, all of them were actually sleeping on the tables behind me. I noticed because I heard a couple snoring. One of them, half-awake, signalled me that I could stay and enjoy the match and that I should turn off the TV when I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this actually marvellous and totally brightened up my day. I took note of the place and decided to repay it the day after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Trawangan Accommodation&quot; id=&quot;gilithotels&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Accommodation in Gili Trawangan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gili Trawangan is the most touristic island of the three northern Gilis (Trawangan, Air, Meno).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are sufficient accommodation types for everyone: resorts, bungalows, homestays, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Personally, I would avoid the first line on the beach, as it’s the main road and full of loud tourists all day &amp;amp; night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I also would avoid going too deep into the island. Maybe after the first block is ideal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you stay for long, I would only book the first night, so you’ve got a place to keep as a basecamp, and then walk around to find better deals and better places.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Gili Trawangan, and in the Gili Islands, the level of the accommodation venues drops significantly. The differences between the photos online and real life can be outrageous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-16-gili-trawangan-in-depth&quot;&gt;Day 16: Gili Trawangan in depth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you actually &lt;em&gt;walked around&lt;/em&gt; an entire island? Turns out, Gili T is walkable in its entirety in about two hours at a mid-fast pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my Bali belly had improved lots, I decided to give it a go for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I spent most of the previous day indoors. I am an outdoors creature and needed fresh air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would allow me to see the island in its entirety. At least the coast.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would allow me to find good beaches.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would allow me to find another spot to watch the sunset from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It would allow me to play Pokémon Go, which I could not do in Gili Gede nor with the Bali belly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I could cross that off my bucket list. Yes: I had that on my bucket list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me about two hours, give or take, but I got all the information I needed. After another yoghurt &amp;amp; ice-cream lunch, I set out to relax on the beach for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the port, I decided to walk up north, as I had seen that the best beaches are up there. Halfway to my destination, I spotted a sign that read &lt;em&gt;turtle point&lt;/em&gt; in between two diving agencies. I thought to myself that the turtles would actually be found only diving, at a respectable depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out I was so wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beach was actually nice enough, and after the first walk around the island, I had bought an underwater bag (when you travel alone and you don’t want to leave stuff unattended on the sand - works like a charm!), so I decided to give the bag a go (after performing a security check first).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, not even a minute in the water, I came across a turtle! The darn thing was big. The only turtles I had ever seen in the wild, in Europe, were no larger than 10 centimetres. This one must have been at least a meter long, I reckon! I did not get very close to it because I did not know whether they are aggressive or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-reminder:&lt;/strong&gt; Buy a god-damn GoPro to immortalise moments like this one or the snorkelling in Gili Gede.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, off the bucket list! Turtle sighting was one of the things I came to Indonesia for. Another included dolphins, but since I did not go to the north part of Bali, that would not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I resumed the walk to another beach up north, and really enjoyed it as well, even if it was windier than in the east coast (winds coming from the west).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time passed by, and it was almost sunset time, so I walked counter-clockwise to catch the sunset in the western part of the island (it’s the place to be) and found myself halfway through my second walk around the island. So not only did I walk around the island &lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt;. I did it &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Trawangan Working&quot; id=&quot;gilitworking&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I needed to do some stuff with proper internet, I went to a beach bar called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664666-d7122041-Reviews-Serene_Sunset-Gili_Trawangan_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html&quot; title=&quot;Serene Sunset&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Serene Sunset&lt;/a&gt; (wifi password: &lt;em&gt;lovelife&lt;/em&gt;) where I drank a banana smoothie to calm the stomach. The wifi was quite decent and I got to stargaze for a while. No shooting stars for me, however!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wifi for remote workers or digital nomads isn’t really easy to find on this island, neither on any of the Gili islands per se. So if you happen to come across any, stick to it and don’t risk going to other places. Else, buy a SIM card here (more expensive than in Bali) so you can tether your connection and get stuff done properly. Gili Trawangan has a decent coverage of 4G around the main town and other populated areas. Not so much on the other Gilis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Trawangan Food&quot; id=&quot;gilitfood&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For dinner, I returned to the aforementioned restaurant, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664666-d8809406-Reviews-Warung_Warna-Gili_Trawangan_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html&quot; title=&quot;Warung Warna&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Warung Warna&lt;/a&gt;, where I watched the Barcelona match the previous night, and it was quite crowded. They actually had a live band performing really nice renditions of Daft Punk, Oasis, Rolling Stones, Johnny Cash and many other bands I dig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me an hour, literally, to order. Every time I signalled one of the waiters, he told me that his colleague was coming. However, I had the wifi password and my laptop with me, so I decided to blog for a while and go through my email for the first time in days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tuna steak I ordered came also late, rather cold and way overcooked. However, since they had been so kind to me the night before, I decided to eat it up. Plus, I had gotten some work done and I enjoyed a live concert! A good night, altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this experience, food is great on Gili Trawangan, and I’ve been recommended many places by my friends, so I wish I had stayed longer to try them, as I wasn’t exactly lucky with my own choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Foursquare is kind of useless around this area, as the majority of restaurants have neither reviews nor a rating. And I am not a TripAdvisor guy, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Activities in Gili Trawangan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walking around the island is so cool. It takes about two hours to complete the round trip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plenty of diving &amp;amp; snorkel agencies available.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As any touristic village, it offers plenty of things to do, from massages to shopping, or cosmetic treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At night, some bars offer beer pong and other drinking games.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some concerts will allow you to jam or sing with them. Others just take song requests. The rest are just cool players!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Meno&quot; id=&quot;gilimeno&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-17-gili-meno&quot;&gt;Day 17: Gili Meno&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day started early, at about 8am, in order to go to the port and catch the boat to Gili Meno. I paid 120k rupees for a fast boat, but I have heard prices go up and down depending on the urgency you seem to have for the trip. Since I booked the trip the night before, I might’ve paid a little bit more. However, I heard people that paid 200k the very same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indications as to where the check-in was were not really clear. I kept asking people and they would send me up and down the port according to a very broad range of criteria of diverse nature. That is: bollocks. Be ready for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat ride is about ten to fifteen minutes long, as Gili Meno is the island right next to Trawangan. Some people stay in the boat to go to Gili Air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Meno Accommodation&quot; id=&quot;gilimenohotels&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accommodation-1&quot;&gt;Accommodation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to my next stay, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booking.com/hotel/id/turtle-gili-meno-bungalows.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQKoAgM;sid=0cabdb635bbe2465563c461c92ddaf8e.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQKoAgM;sid=0cabdb635bbe2465563c461c92ddaf8e&quot; title=&quot;Turtle Gili Meno Bungalows&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turtle Gili Meno Bungalows&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mere five-minutes walk from the beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place is calm and cosy, not along the shoreline, as many of the other accommodation options, but not far. It is clean enough and the employees are super nice as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wifi is really bad, and one can barely browse through the email. I am not doing any work from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you’ve got a very vast selection of hotels, bungalows and homestays all around the island, for all kind of budgets and travellers. I had no trouble booking the night before, but looks like in the Gili Islands, the best thing is just arriving there and booking on the spot after you check two or three of them, if you’ve got the time for it and don’t mind some walking carrying your backpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-island&quot;&gt;The island&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gili Meno is the smallest &amp;amp; calmest of the three northern Gilis. There’s not much going on besides the diving &amp;amp; snorkelling and strolling around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, it reminds me of Gili Gede if it were not for the fact that Meno is really clean and well kept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the size, it is somewhat smaller than Trawangan. Crossing it horizontally took me about 15 minutes. Walking around it should take no longer than 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;eating--going-out&quot;&gt;Eating &amp;amp; going out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because this island is more laid back and relaxed, I haven’t seen any place with live music or celebrations. There are no more than 10 places to eat in the main village, and a few others scattered around the rest of the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to Trawangan, you should have dinner before 9PM, or else you won’t find anything open. Just a very fancy &amp;amp; expensive restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The locals know that not so many tourists come here to stay, but because the variety of places is so scarce, the prices are “expensive” for Indonesian standards. As a matter of fact, I’ve just had breakfast for 70k rupees, more expensive than what I’d pay for a breakfast in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that has really surprised me is that the local speciality seems to be pizza. Every place has a stone oven and cooks its own pizza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beaches&quot;&gt;Beaches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent my first day checking out the northern half of the island, where I found the best beach so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking for white sand &amp;amp; crystal clear waters? This is your place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the entire morning snorkelling by myself around the northern beaches and ate at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664665-d4782937-Reviews-Ana_Warung-Gili_Meno_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html&quot; title=&quot;Ana Warung&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ana Warung&lt;/a&gt;. The food is good enough and it’s located right in front of the sea. I couldn’t get the wifi to work (it did not even load the login page), so go figure. I do recommend eating there just because of the views and because the place is cool, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To watch the sunset, you should go to the part of the island that faces Trawangan (west, obviously) and sit in one of the many cafès over there, as they all look kind of cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Gili Meno Trivia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire island can be walked around in one hour and a half tops.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t expect to find dinner places open past 9PM.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There seems to be a lot of bamboo tattoo places on this island.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out the salt lake, both by day and at night, to get real nice pictures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’d wager that the best places to eat are actually outside the main town.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a turtle sanctuary south of the port with small turtles. Make a donation to keep them alive!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right next to it there’s a big “MENO” sign to take cool pictures. Don’t leave without it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-18-exploring-gili-meno&quot;&gt;Day 18: Exploring Gili Meno&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off the day needing to check some emails and set things right for the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, so I googled where’s the best wifi in the island to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to the port, I stumbled upon a place called &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/bibis-cafe/506ab652e4b0b2645cfb690c&quot; title=&quot;Bibi's Cafe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bibi’s Café&lt;/a&gt;, where surprisingly I found a decent wifi. This will be my choice for Skype calls and important stuff. The breakfast itself wasn’t anything extraordinary, but it served its purpose. I paid 70k rupees for some scrambled eggs with toast, a fruit salad and a tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I worked out using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.8fit.com&quot; title=&quot;8fit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;8fit&lt;/a&gt;, which is my fitness app of choice. Because of the Bali belly, I hadn’t worked out in a couple of days, but today I felt good enough again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, I decided to get something off my bucket list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I did with Gili Trawangan, I decided to circle around the island by foot. This time, however, I stopped to enjoy the places, instead of doing an exploration trip first and then stopping in the second round, as I did in Gili T. Otherwise, the entire walk would’ve taken me no more than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I snorkelled in the four cardinal points of the island, starting with the south, which was the richest by far, in terms of fish &amp;amp; underwater stuff to see. The sand and the beach itself were really clean, and I really liked this part of the island best. I was truly the only person in maybe half a kilometre around and didn’t even need to take my waterproof bag with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then proceeded to go east, where I went back to the main town. North of town it is quiet enough to go snorkelling, without having to worry too much about the passing boats. I think I caught glimpse of a distant turtle, but couldn’t chase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, about 3PM, the sun was hiding behind the trees, so I moved to the north, where I had been the day before. It was exactly the same experience, with some extra insights now: the southern beach had not as many bugs as this one here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Bugs” means flies, ants and - most importantly - this little white flea-like insect that bounces around you all the time. They’re called &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebugchicks.com/arthropods/beach-bugs-thats-an-arthropod/&quot; title=&quot;Amphipods&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amphipods or sand flea&lt;/a&gt;. They come in great numbers, sometimes, and they can be a real pain in the ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the tide went lower, hence making the waters shallower by the hour, I stopped snorkelling and moved to the western side of the island, pretty much where I started, and watched the sunset from one of the many beach bars there, sipping coconut water. Hydrate yourselves, kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also worth mentioning that the island does have a salt lake in the middle. It is a cool spot to go during the day to take photos. Close to it, there’s a small natural reservation for birds and local species that some websites seem to recommend visiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrapped up the day by eating like a m*therf*cker in the Rust Waruna that’s by the port. Ate an indecent amount of fish &amp;amp; seafood for about 25 USD. Not really the best quality, but can’t complain, given the copious amount of food on the dishes and the price. Don’t order western food, as it’s of the worst quality. Try to get only local dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wifi here is actually quite good (password: &lt;em&gt;freshjuice&lt;/em&gt;), so I’m adding it to the list of wifi worth working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy cow! This thing has been growing too much. I might have to chunk it up in parts or else publish it as an ebook. No one’s going to read something over an hour long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodnight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sampai yimpai&lt;/em&gt; - Goodbye!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terima kasih&lt;/em&gt; - Thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terima kasih kembali&lt;/em&gt; - You’re welcome.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ya&lt;/em&gt; - Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tidak&lt;/em&gt; - No.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Air minum&lt;/em&gt; - Mineral water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Merdeka&lt;/em&gt; - Freedom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-19-relax--books&quot;&gt;Day 19: Relax &amp;amp; Books&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After almost two years and twenty books in between, I finally finished the &lt;em&gt;A Song of Fire and Ice&lt;/em&gt; book saga. That means I can watch the Game of Throne series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On day 19th, I realised that I was getting more and more bored on Gili Meno, which is precisely what I wanted to do in this trip: reach a place with nothing more to do than sitting on the sand and let time pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked this feeling so much that I extended one day my stay here. Six days on an island like this one is quite a challenge for an active person such as me, but it also helps me get shit done like finishing books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My entire day consisted of trying new Warunas (Indonesian food places) while finishing the book. Nothing remarkable: not a single acceptable wifi and the places I tried were quite average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so fixed finishing the book, that I inadvertently missed the dinner deadline. Remember that all restaurants close at 9PM? I didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For good or for bad, one restaurant was open. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664665-d6429529-Reviews-Karma_Beach_Gili_Meno-Gili_Meno_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html&quot; title=&quot;Karma Beach Club&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karma Beach Club&lt;/a&gt; is open until 10.30PM. It’s pricey, but the place is worth it. I ate a tuna tartar and a Portuguese Cataplana while enjoying a nice acoustic guitar concert. The wifi wasn’t too bad (password: &lt;em&gt;karmareef123&lt;/em&gt;). I really recommend this place for that special night or for when you just want to treat yourself to a very good dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrapped up the day by playing billiards at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g664665-d10153645-Reviews-Kura_Kura_Beach_Resort-Gili_Meno_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html&quot; title=&quot;Kura Kura Beach Resort&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kura Kura Beach Resort&lt;/a&gt;. Their wifi is rather bad, but the place is comfortable enough to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Moving around in Gili Meno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ll spend a lot of time walking around, so keep Pokémon Go open and hatch those damn eggs!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t rent a bike unless you only move in the inner part of the island. There’s too much sand to make it worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can always travel with a horse cart, but it’s expensive and there aren’t many around the island. Chances are when you need them, you won’t find them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You really do not need to walk around the beach. There are plenty of paths and streets that cross the island vertically and horizontally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At night, make sure you bring a torch or you’ll find yourself walking into horse dung or puddles of mud if you’re outside of town.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lots of frogs and crabs crossing your path at night. Watch your steps!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Gili Meno Activities&quot; id=&quot;gilimenoactivities&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-20-snorkel-trip&quot;&gt;Day 20: Snorkel trip&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freaking love the people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.booking.com/hotel/id/turtle-gili-meno-bungalows.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQKoAgM;sid=0cabdb635bbe2465563c461c92ddaf8e.html?label=gen173nr-1FCAEoggJCAlhYSDNiBW5vcmVmaGiIAQGYATG4AQfIAQzYAQHoAQH4AQKoAgM;sid=0cabdb635bbe2465563c461c92ddaf8e&quot; title=&quot;Turtle Gili Meno Bungalows&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turtle Gili Meno Bungalows&lt;/a&gt;. They’re making my stay unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are super attentive, nice and always there, offering help here and there. For instance, with a snorkel trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, when they said 500k for a private trip, I was quite sceptical. Public trips (20+ people) cost 200k, so I decided to pay a little bit more and have it &lt;em&gt;just for me&lt;/em&gt;. Boy, was I right about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about an hour and a half, we checked four points: the turtle point, the coral garden, a sunken ship and a nameless spot. In the first two of them, we stopped close to the other boats (public, most of them) and saw them swarming with people. I would not have enjoyed that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I liked about my boat is that this one had safety jackets and other equipment (the one in Gili Gede did not have it!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The turtle point was really nice. Turtles must’ve been about 15-20 meters deep, too much for me, but you could see them clearly. On the way to the turtle point we saw a couple coming to the surface and once there, one of them came relatively close to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coral garden was easily the best spot of all four because it was shallower and one could get through the coral and very close to cool things. Same with the nameless spot, but I didn’t find it that interesting save for a couple of weird fishes and a squid (first time I see one alive!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the turtle and the sunken ship spots were cool but too deep for one to snorkel around. Diving there would’ve been quite an experience, though. Around the ship, I saw so many divers, so I guess that’s the thing to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My afternoon adventures brought me to find one of the coolest places with the best food. It’s actually called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664665-d4740112-Reviews-Diana_cafe-Gili_Meno_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html?t=664665&quot; title=&quot;Diana Cafe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Diana Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, and I found the best people, really refreshing fruit, milkshakes and a super tasty cheese &amp;amp; vegetables omelette (big, really big!) and one of the coolest setups to watch the sunset. A priceless finding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night I decided to return to Rust Restaurant because of its good internet but found that it wasn’t working nearly as good. In fact, I couldn’t even get Gmail to load. Maybe it was too crowded by the time I arrived, so I blogged instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Working out&quot; id=&quot;workout&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Working Out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Working out while you travel can be difficult. I, for one, use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.8fit.com&quot; title=&quot;8fit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;8fit&lt;/a&gt;. I get no commission out of this. I’m just a happy user.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;8fit gives you high-intensity workouts that last no longer than 20 minutes, so you can take your daily dose of exercise while having time to enjoy everything else.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Bali, there are enough gyms for you to choose from. Most of them have daily passes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High-class hotels tend to have their own gym. On Booking.com you can actually filter your search to get only facilities with a gym.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I saw a gym on Gili Air but didn’t really notice any on Trawangan. I’m sure there’s one or two, given that it is the biggest and the most touristic of the three northern Gilis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I haven’t seen any gym on Gili Trawangan.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If neither gyms nor apps are your thing, walking is pretty good exercise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You’ll also swim a lot, especially if you dive or snorkel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-21-working-from-gili-meno&quot;&gt;Day 21: Working from Gili Meno&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my flight back is on the 29th, I’ve resolved to plan my way back to the airport and work a little bit to tackle some of the tasks I need to take care of next week. Since I will be travelling a couple of days, I need to tackle some stuff before the flights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having exercised with 8fit again, I resolved to go to Malligan’s Cafe to go and taste their pizza. After all, Gili Meno is famous for their pizzas, and Foursquare seems to agree that here’s the place to satisfy my pizza needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pizza is not great. It’s average, at best. But it’s pizza, and as many say: good pizza is good, and bad pizza is still good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually a good place to work, as they have &lt;em&gt;sockets&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the only place I’ve seen that they have got sockets available. But we’re talking that all the bars/restaurants/cafes on the island are on the beach, so I don’t know how well fares that with electric installations. The wifi, however, was not working today, but the password is &lt;em&gt;uni123456&lt;/em&gt;. Will try again another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I booked my boat passage back to Bali through my hotel, which was super easy. The trip cost 450k rupees and includes transport to wherever you need to be in Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I checked out another place that I have been seeing for days: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/@-8.3572852,116.0540228,16z&quot; title=&quot;Cafe Gili&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cafe Gili&lt;/a&gt;. It must be a really new place, as it is not in either Tripadvisor or Foursquare. So I linked to their coordinates on Google Maps instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As most places on the south-western side of the island, it has a really nice swimming pool. The wifi is quite good (username: &lt;em&gt;meno&lt;/em&gt; password: &lt;em&gt;123&lt;/em&gt;) and the food tastes amazing. A real good discovery, plus the pool is just too cool to wash off the salt from the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrapped up the day having dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664665-d3800167-Reviews-We_Be_Cafe-Gili_Meno_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html&quot; title=&quot;WeBe' Cafe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WeBe’ Cafe&lt;/a&gt;, where I had a seafood kebab (kebab is a skewer, not that pita-wrapped thing we eat in the west!) and enjoyed another great acoustic concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Island Style&quot; id=&quot;islandstyle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Island style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Things take longer on the islands. It’s a pretty widespread tendency everywhere, but on the Gili islands, some things seem to take a lot of time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a general sense of “I don’t give a fuck” about stuff that is both cool and frustrating at times.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive at a cafe or restaurant, do not expect them to notice you. Wave at the waiters when they look in your direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waiting for an hour to get your food is seemingly accepted here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Quick trip to Gili Air&quot; id=&quot;giliair&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-22-daily-excursion-to-gili-air&quot;&gt;Day 22: Daily excursion to Gili Air&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last day on Gili Meno, I decided to do a quick trip to Gili Air. If you go to the port and ask for the “Island Hopping” ticket (35k rupees one way), you can experience 5 hours of Gili Air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat leaves at about 10AM and returns at 3PM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The island can be walked around in about 45-50 minutes, depending on your pace. As I had a really windy day, sitting on the beach wasn’t really comfortable. Instead, I just walked about and then grabbed lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/mowies-bar/549a2953498ebc7d8c48bd41&quot; title=&quot;Mowie's Bar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mowies&lt;/a&gt;, which is the highest-rated place of the island on Foursquare. That must be a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tuna burger was really freaking good and overall the place was dope. A beach bar with a really cool vibe The wifi wasn’t very good, but enough to check some websites and maybe email (username: &lt;em&gt;aali&lt;/em&gt; password: &lt;em&gt;123&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat back was rocking too much because of the wind and some people got seriously seasick. The situation worsened when we couldn’t make port because the sea was so wild, and the 10-minute boat trip turned into a 40-something-minutes wild ride! I kept on reading on my Kindle, but at times it felt like we would drown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to safety, I decided to return to the comforts of Gili Café, where I went yesterday, to write this, eat some fresh fruit (overpriced but tasty!) and relax by the pool. I’ve also witnessed my last sunset on this charming island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it was my last night on the island and the weather forecast for tomorrow is &lt;em&gt;windy&lt;/em&gt; I decided to eat well tonight. If I die tomorrow on the boat back to Bali, I will die with lobster in my belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g664665-d6429529-Reviews-Karma_Beach_Gili_Meno-Gili_Meno_Gili_Islands_Lombok_West_Nusa_Tenggara.html&quot; title=&quot;Karma Beach Club&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karma Beach Club&lt;/a&gt; and ordered Grilled Octopus as a starter, and 350g of lobster. I topped it off with a chocolate mousse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot recall any time in my life where I ate an octopus as good as this one. It was just delicious: tender as it can get and crispy where needed. It was a real delicatessen. As for the lobster, I can only recommend it. I cannot recall whether I had eaten lobster before in my life, so I found it magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If death should find me in my sleep tonight, or tomorrow on the boat, I will face it with a grin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Cinema and Movies&quot; id=&quot;movies&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Movies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have found a very interesting culture of open-air cinemas in both Bali and the Gili Islands.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some bars will project a different movie every night that you can watch for free (provided you are a customer at said bar).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Movies are in English with English subtitles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-23-back-to-bali&quot;&gt;Day 23: Back to Bali&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power had gone off during the night. I noticed when the AC stopped working as I was reading before falling asleep. When I woke up in the morning, there was no power yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out, something had broken and left the three Gili islands without electricity. Luckily enough, my devices’ batteries (iPad, phone, laptop) were almost full, and I had a SIM card, so I didn’t need to depend on wifi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I packed up under the constant glare of a big spider (half an inch, this time) which, judging by the size of it, might be the next tenant of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re to leave Meno direction Bali, you’ll go with the fast boat that first stops in Trawangan. Check-out time, 10.30AM in the port, and departure time at 11.30AM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat arrived on time, but because the bad weather rendered a very windy day, we had to board the boat in turns. In Gili Meno, the fast boat doesn’t reach the shore (I think it’s due to the coral reef that surrounds the islands, hence water not being sufficiently deep), so a floating platform transfers people from the shore to the boat. We did it in two turns and, boy was the sea raging!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took the first turn and hoped that waiting in the big boat for the second turn would be safer, but the boat rocked heavily. At times, I felt like the waves would turn either the platform or the boat upside down. Or both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we had been all loaded, we set off to Gili Trawangan (barely 15 minutes ride) to exchange some passengers. I don’t know how they do it to unload the proper luggage all the time, and hope mine will make it to Bali.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loading in Trawangan, with a more clement weather, was easier and thus fast. In less than 20 minutes we were headed towards the northern part of Bali (Padang Bay), where the transfer to the hotel and my suitcase (hopefully!) would meet me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took one hour from Gili Trawangan to Padang Bay, but the boat took almost another hour to park in the port, as there seemed to be a lot of traffic today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once there, you will be swarmed by tonnes of taxi drivers telling you that the bus is “long ride” which will take “three or four hours”. Screw that. It only took one hour and a half to reach Kuta and we had some traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Padang Bay, there’s a public toilet (3k rupees) and plenty of stores to buy food, in case you didn’t bring it from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Kuta, I was barely 1km away from the hotel, so I didn’t even bother taking a taxi (they leave you in some big bus stop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I left Gili Meno at 11.30 and arrived at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/13963715?eluid=1&amp;amp;euid=b9bd89ac-870d-bc45-ffef-b4390e21528f&quot; title=&quot;J4 Hotel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;J4 Hotel&lt;/a&gt; at 17.30. Six hours from door to door. Luckily enough, the bus trip was kinda fun playing Pokémon Go (lots of Pokéstops along the road!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hotel is really incredible, for the price I paid for a room (40 euros). It’s got a rooftop swimming pool, the facilities are really good (I’d say it could be a 4-stars hotel), the wifi works very well and the bar &amp;amp; restaurant prices are very affordable. Furthermore, the food is really good. I cannot recommend this place enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just spent the rest of the evening at the hotel, eating at their restaurant and chilling in the pool, to charge batteries for the flights on the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Down in Kuta&quot; id=&quot;kuta&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Down in Kuta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you happen to go down to Kuta, you’ll be amazed on how more &lt;em&gt;intense&lt;/em&gt; it is compared to Canggu or Ubud.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will feel as a complete tourist and be treated like that everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pickpockets happen to be frequent, sadly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone will offer you a ride, drugs or other kinds of services as you walk down the street.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The city centre looks like a massive shopping mall. You can buy anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#toc&quot; title=&quot;Back to top&quot;&gt;Back to top.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-24-back-home&quot;&gt;Day 24: Back home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I went to bed, I discovered the only downside to having chosen this hotel: it is located between two nightclubs. Two &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt; nightclubs. However, nothing that some earplugs cannot solve. I slept like a baby, and this hasn’t changed my opinion about the hotel at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am amazed at the value they provide for barely 40 euros a night. The free buffet breakfast was nothing short of exceptional, and being able to sunbathe and chill by the pool until checkout (12PM) was really great. I am extremely thankful for this experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took (alegally) an Uber to the airport. From where I was, taxis would ask for 100-150k rupees to take me to the airport, which was a robbery. I paid 31k rupees with Uber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived in Denpasar, it was already dark and I was kind of tired. I failed to observe how beautiful this airport is. It is built with the style of a traditional temple and there are gardens and paintings everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I went to the airport six hours prior to the flight (I had nothing better to do), I decided to explore it a little bit. I found it quite expensive, and it could offer more sockets to visitors, but overall it’s a good airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, this guide ends. Finish. Finito. Ende. Fin. EOF (for the geeks!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Airport&quot; id=&quot;airport&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things you need to know: Denpasar International Airport&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expensive as fuck!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beautiful, however, and worthy of some photos.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Uber to get to it from Kuta. You might not find Uber if you’re northern than Seminyak.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of traffic, make sure you leave for the airport fairly early. You don’t want to be stuck in traffic when your plane is taking off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Albeit expensive, the food is great in most places.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a nice selection of shops. I really liked the business &amp;amp; management section of the bookstore and felt tempted to buy all of them!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’re a Pokémon Go gym and some stops so you can pack up stuff before your flight!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s free wifi but I didn’t get to test it, as I used my SIM card to tether my last megabytes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sockets are hard to find unless you’re in a restaurant or cafeteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Tips for a 24h Layover in Doha, Qatar</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/08/07/Tips-for-a-24h-layover-in-Doha-Qatar.html" />
      <updated>2016-08-07T08:03:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/08/07/Tips-for-a-24h-layover-in-Doha-Qatar</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160807.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160807.png&quot; title=&quot;Flight schedules board&quot; alt=&quot;Flight schedules board&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; If you are a frequent traveller, chances are, you are going to have some long layovers. My most recent trip to Bali saw me stopping for 20 hours in Doha, Qatar, so I learnt a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, some background: I was travelling from Barcelona to Denpasar, Bali, to spend 25 days relaxing in south-eastern Asia. Since there are no direct flights covering this route, I had to choose between many different cities where I had to stop to change planes, so I chose Doha, Qatar, as I was flying with Qatar Airlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually chose a one-day layover so I could see the city, as I had never been in Qatar. I arrived at 8am and had to leave past midnight. Hence, I spent one day in the dusty capital of Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-airport&quot;&gt;The Airport&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hamad International Airport is one of the most impressive and well-equipped airports I’ve seen in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The staff are very helpful and there are signs everywhere, to ensure you do not get lost in such a big airport. Instructions are clear enough and I did not have any trouble to get out of &amp;amp; back into the airport during my transit hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wifi is all around the airport, and while I was expecting a 15-minute-for-free shitty connection that would ask for all my personal data, I found a very stable (albeit not super fast) connection that would last for all day, and for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160807airport.png&quot; title=&quot;Doha Airport&quot; alt=&quot;Doha Airport&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;A freaking big wild Pokémon appeared!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth mentioning: if you’re playing Pokémon Go, there are 5 gyms inside the airport and plenty of Pokéstops. Since I was required to come back two hours before my flight (made it three, just in case) I could spend them hunting around and I caught rare species! Well worth it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, food in the Hamad airport is great, if only a tad too expensive. The variety and opening hours go beyond the European standards, where most places close at 10PM and offer just sandwiches, pizza and maybe a stand of local food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a SIM card at the airport. Vodafone offers 1GB SIM card for circa 10USD, which is fine for 24 hours. Do it: it’s a life saver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go to the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-city-doha&quot;&gt;The city: Doha&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doha is the capital of Qatar, which is one of the richest countries in the Persian Gulf (some call if Arabian Gulf). If you want to learn more about it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com/&quot; title=&quot;Just Fucking Google It&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JFGI&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not going to copy&amp;amp;paste Wikipedia stuff just to rank better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160807doha.png&quot; title=&quot;Doha&quot; alt=&quot;Doha&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;I felt like an insect there.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reach Doha easily from the airport, as it is barely 20 minutes away by car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Uber, just because I do not trust taxi drivers at all. However, I have been told that in Qatar, taxi drivers aren’t driving you around in circles. The only problem with local taxis is that since streets don’t have names, and the city is under constant construction, they might not know where they’re going. Also, most, if not all, of the local taxi drivers aren’t from Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uber solves all of that. Oh, and let me plug in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uber.com/invite/q02bp&quot; title=&quot;Uber affiliate link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Uber affiliate link&lt;/a&gt;, in case you don’t have an account and want to sign up for the service. All of this, for free, and shamelessly. You’re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city is not very big, and most sightseeings are in the same area. However, be prepared to see lots of luxury buildings and skyscrapers that make no sense whatsoever. As an artificial city, that’s as true as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in all cities that are in the middle of the desert, all activity happens indoors. Do not expect to see people outside. I only found people walking at night, all along the Corniche Promenade, which is a nice walk along the sea. Even at night, temperatures were too hot at this time of the year (August).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another two important things to mention are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plugs are type G &amp;amp; D. Chances are, you don’t know what this means. Just use &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatplug.info/from/uk/to/qatar&quot; title=&quot;Whatplug.info&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WhatPlug.info&lt;/a&gt; in all your trips.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The weekend is Friday and Saturday. Therefore, the week starts on Sunday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are here for work, and can work remotely, I suggest you go to the big hotels and work from their cafeterias. I, for one, went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whoteldoha.com&quot; title=&quot;W Hotel Doha&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;W Hotel&lt;/a&gt; because Foursquare rated its cafeteria very high. I concur, food is awesome there, and so is coffee. But for those budget-savvy, I would not recommend this experience. It’s a five-star hotel, and prices are well aligned with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cheaper option is to look for a local café or a shopping mall. Wifi is also great there. Because I went on a weekend and very early in the morning, everything was closed except the main shopping mall and the biggest hotels. Hopefully, you will have a bigger selection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are here for leisure, you might want to check TripAdvisor. I was totally deceived, as there are only churches &amp;amp; museums to visit. I’m just not that kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doha is not a city to walk around checking nice buildings and randomly encountering statues or things worth Instagramming. One must needs take a taxi/Uber for everything. Buses, while well-prepared, aren’t exactly useful, as they only cover main roads &amp;amp; you don’t want to wait for them for too long under 50 degrees celsius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re in Doha outside of the warmest months, a power walk along the Corniche Promenade looks like the thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At night, most of the skyscrapers and important buildings are lit, thus looking better for your shots. Some of them are pretty remarkable. Also, some of them host nice parties, I’ve been told. But since I was too down-dressed, I did not even bother going to any, as all of them have dresscode (polo or shirt plus long trousers for men). I was wearing a football t-shirt, shorts &amp;amp; running shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the food, during weekends they have brunch / free buffets in most hotels and malls, which are very good options to taste the local specialities. I ate at the Main City Mall at a free buffet for the equivalent of 30USD, which I found a good deal given the quality and variety of food there was. Elsewise, I would recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://foursquare.com/v/%D8%B2%D8%B9%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D9%88-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%AA/4ca7781eb0b8236ab5baa9e6&quot; title=&quot;Eating out in Doha, Qatar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zaatar W Zeit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, hydrate yourself constantly buying bottled mineral water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-not-to-do&quot;&gt;What not to do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;August might be the worst time of the year to visit the city. It is plainly JUST TOO HOT. My phone alerted me, but I decided to go for a 15 minutes walk to reach the city center after I spent a morning working from a hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160807hot.JPG&quot; title=&quot;Hot temperatures in Qatar&quot; alt=&quot;Hot temperatures in Qatar&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Full disclaimer: Temperatures are in celsius.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Five minutes in the walk and I was soaked to the bone as if I had been thrown into a swimming pool. Therefore, I would suggest not walking under the sun during the hot season, which is most of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People were yelling at me from their cars asking me what I was doing or giving me weird looks, as I was the only person walking the streets. In 15 minutes, I encountered no one going by foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated above, consume bottled mineral water. Do absolutely not drink from the tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also recommend avoiding rising too early. During the weekends, Qataris stay at home until well past lunchtime, and won’t most likely go out until it’s dark. Then, they go to the mall. So until 4PM, malls are deserted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least: one would expect that temperatures drop when it’s dark. Not in Doha. During the warm season, the temperature is constant throughout the day, and when it’s dark, it just becomes even more humid, thus becoming extremely unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was my experience for almost 24h in Doha, Qatar, in between two night flights. Hope you found it useful. Feel free to share your experience in the comments section below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How a Week of Remote Work Boosts my Productivity Enormously</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/07/24/How-a-week-of-remote-work-boosts-my-productivity-enormously.html" />
      <updated>2016-07-24T21:03:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/07/24/How-a-week-of-remote-work-boosts-my-productivity-enormously</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160724.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160724.png&quot; title=&quot;Motorboad sailing&quot; alt=&quot;Motorboat sailing&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; I really &lt;strong&gt;REALLY&lt;/strong&gt; like to travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to travel as much as my work permits me. And my work allows me to do it: I own a company called &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; whose core beliefs include remote working. Our entire team is distributed, and only 50% of it resides in Barcelona. Plus, we have no offices whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, however, am in charge of business development. That means, doing field work to increase the number of deals for the company. As a service provider, our main source of income is client work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly over half of our clients are from Barcelona. That means, I need to do a lot of field work there to meet them, attend the same meetings, do business lunches, and such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the rest of our clients come from very diverse countries like Singapore, Germany or USA. I need to increase this, so I can travel more, and meet less people in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every now and then (less often than required, but more often than some of my peeps like), I take a break from my city, and shoot for a week of working remotely to increase my productivity. As a matter of fact, I am writing this post from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.es/maps/place/Ciutadella+de+Menorca,+Balearic+Islands/@39.9922421,3.8189973,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x12be035c34fdeb71:0x402af6ed721fec0!8m2!3d39.9990786!4d3.8389415?hl=en&quot; title=&quot;Ciutadella de Menorca on Google maps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ciutadella, Menorca&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-am-forced-out-of-meetings&quot;&gt;I am forced out of meetings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting someone in person requires some travel time. On average, in Barcelona, it takes me 30 minutes to go virtually anywhere, and another 30 minutes back to my place. If the meeting is one hour long, I’m spending two hours in total.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can get worse: people are late most of the time, thus adding more time to your already-too-long meeting. Sometimes, they even push it back to later in the day when you have already travelled there. Outrageous, but it happens. This is an ultimate time-drainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when I am working remotely, I ask people if it’s possible that we meet on Skype for a short chat. I will then schedule 30-minute calls. Therefore, total time invested: 30 min tops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why only 30 minutes? The rule is simple: if you meet someone for 10 minutes, you’ll spend 15 talking. If you schedule for 30, it can go up to one hour. If you schedule an hour, it’ll probably go longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By doing shorter calls that require no commuting, I save a ton of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-dont-get-dragged-into-events&quot;&gt;I don’t get dragged into events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in Barcelona, I always keep an eye out for interesting events in the city. I am just talking about business events, where I can potentially meet new clients, follow up with existing ones, scout for new hires, or even learn about technologies or market tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it happens with meetings, events also require some travel time, that adds to the duration of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I travel, I might go to events as well, but I normally go to islands, where not much is going on. Not even regular events. So chances of that are low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, time invested in meetings: 0 hours and 0 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wi-fi-might-be-scarce&quot;&gt;Wi-fi might be scarce&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-travelled people know that wifi ain’t precisely very stable nor very common on islands. I mean, good wifi. A mediocre wifi, you can find everywhere. But wifi for working, less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because wifi might be uncommon or a precious thing to have, I try to make the most out of it when I do it, so I concentrate all Internet-requiring tasks for when I will have good wifi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Well, I always try to book places with wifi, but turns out it’s normally an average connection with lots of intermission, not really suited for videoconferences nor intensive usage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-will-meet-new-people&quot;&gt;I will meet new people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to travel alone, so I don’t get a biased opinion on the place, nor someone who will show me around. I like exploring places by myself, at my on pace, or even choosing not to explore the place, if I really have work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I do, I will meet people. As you chit-chat, or even when you break the ice, you ask and get asked about work. So I always tell them what I do. This helps me to perfect my pitch and, who knows, I might be talking to a potential customer, or to someone who might refer me to a potential customer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but I will also tell them about what I am working on at the moment, so I can get their feedback. For instance, if I am writing a blog post about the Ionic framework, I will try to explain them what that is, so I can polish the post’s structure by explaining it to someone else. This might help me to restructure it or to rewrite a paragraph where I was stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, they will give me very valuable feedback. Most of the time, as simple as it might be, it’s valuable. Believe me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theres-time-to-enjoy-yourself&quot;&gt;There’s time to enjoy yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, these small breaks from your city allow you to explore new cities or countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, in itself, might trick your brain into thinking that you’re on holidays. If your trip is long enough, you will take advantage of a weekend or two abroad. You’re already there, so travel time didn’t count, right? It is obvious that a weekend somewhere else feels better than a weekend in your city, to break away from the routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, because you might want to make the most out of your trip, you will work more intensively so your working hours don’t stretch during the day (I do that &lt;strong&gt;all the time&lt;/strong&gt;). This way, you will have time to explore your surroundings &amp;amp; try new stuff (food, beverages, parties, long walks, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentally, and also physically, it will feel like a small vacation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it feels like this is the way I recharge my batteries outside of holidays. Does that work for you, too? Where do you usually go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Playing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-spotify&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Sodom - Styptic Parasite.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fuck SEO. Let's Blog for Human Beings</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/06/02/Fuck-SEO-lets-blog-for-humans-not-robots.html" />
      <updated>2016-06-02T23:03:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/06/02/Fuck-SEO-lets-blog-for-humans-not-robots</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160522.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160522.png&quot; title=&quot;Human Being&quot; alt=&quot;Human Being&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; When was the last time you optimised a blog post for human beings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question came to me yesterday, after I had to review all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/archive/&quot; title=&quot;All my posts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my previous posts&lt;/a&gt; because I implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters&quot; title=&quot;Facebook Open Graph&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Facebook’s Open Graph&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview&quot; title=&quot;Twitter cards&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter Cards&lt;/a&gt; on this website and in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a blogger and an avid reader, I have come to realise that most of the content we read on the web is over-optimised. Over-optimised for SEO. Over-optimised for marketing. Over-optimised to fill your CRM with qualified leads and to rank higher than the competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hit the top when I spent more time tuning a blog entry than actually writing it. I wrote it in less than 30 minutes, and I spent almost an hour looking for the perfect image, writing the &lt;i&gt;alts&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;titles&lt;/i&gt;, linking to previous posts, choosing the keywords, reviewing grammar through Grammarly, and all sorts of optimisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While one could think &lt;i&gt;“oh, this is going to be a rant against Google”&lt;/i&gt;, this is not. I’m going to break down why and when should you optimise and why not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-we-optimise-for-seo&quot;&gt;Why do we optimise for SEO?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just talking about SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) because it’s easier to comprehend to non-marketers, but I am actually talking about optimising content for all sorts of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We optimise for SEO when we want to rank higher on Google and appear more beautifully (using &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog/schema-examples&quot; title=&quot;Schema.org examples&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Schema.org&lt;/a&gt;, for instance). The most common tactics are to choose nice titles, filling your content with the keywords you want to be known for and having a good HTML structure that can be read in all sorts of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we also optimise for social media, which is an important asset nowadays, when we want our content to spread through the social networks. Common practices are to implement the aforementioned Open Graph, Twitter Cards, use social sharing plugins like AddThis, or include an image with each blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this were a rant, I wouldn’t mention the many benefits of optimising our content for all these situations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimised content ranks higher, therefore reaching more people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimised content can be seen by people with all sorts of devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Optimised content can be understood by platforms, who can use it to give us a better service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other benefits, but these are the main ones. If we optimise content, we aim for both an &lt;strong&gt;altruistic&lt;/strong&gt; and an &lt;strong&gt;selfish&lt;/strong&gt; goal. The altruistic is to help to spread your content to people who might need it, and to provide a better experience in the web for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the selfish approach means that we’re just optimising content because we want Google, Facebook, Twitter and the rest of social platforms to understand our content better so that they will give us a better experience in reward. For instance, when we implement their sharing protocols (Schema.org, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, just to name a few) they can focus on analysing content shared using such protocols instead of having to battle against myriads of different content encodings, languages and protocols. This will, in the end, accelerate the process of providing us better &amp;amp; tailored content because they have been able to process faster what we’ve fed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we see that we should blame the player, not the game. The rules are there for everyone to follow them. Some people follow them to do greater good, some other to sell more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-should-we-optimise&quot;&gt;When should we optimise?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the conclusion I’ve reached in the previous section, it seems we should always optimise. After all, the altruistic reasons are better than the selfish ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, life isn’t black and white. There is no rule saying that if we optimise the content we will get 200% more views, or that we will reduce the melting of the Arctic pole if we optimise our blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I see it, it all boils down to &lt;i&gt;what do you want to be known for?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to become famous fast&lt;/strong&gt;, then you should optimise. This will help your content rank better on engines and spread faster on social networks. You’re clearly shooting for the vast majority of the Internet users, who skim through millions of posts and share stuff they might have not read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to spend your time doing meaningful stuff outside of blogging&lt;/strong&gt; then you must rely on your reputation. If you’re famous enough that you don’t care about editing your posts or choosing the right keywords, you will have readers anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it’s quality or quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-should-we-not-optimise&quot;&gt;When should we not optimise?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the content is good, who cares about the form? A best example of this is Mark Suster’s Both Sides of the Table. He spends one hour per post. When the hour finishes, whatever is there gets published. The content is so good that will be shared anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We might not want to optimise the content for SEO if we think that it is so good, heartfelt and brutally honest that people will like it regardless of the form. Moreover, you might want to leave a controversial content out of your blogging strategy because it includes way too many f-bombs or touches a topic that you do not want to be associated with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s your take on all of this? Do you also think we’re exaggerating when we optimise everything so much for marketing purposes or not? I’d love to hear your opinions below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using a Global Network to Reduce the Gender Gap</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/05/10/Using-a-global-network-to-reduce-the-gender-gap.html" />
      <updated>2016-05-10T21:03:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/05/10/Using-a-global-network-to-reduce-the-gender-gap</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160510.jpg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160510.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind SGWomen&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind SGWomen&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Every May, Startup Grind celebrates female entrepreneurship by hosting only female speakers. This year we’ll be 200 chapters doing it. Talk about global reach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative started as a joint action between Startup Grind and Google for Entrepreneurs a couple of years ago, so as to raise awareness of this sad truth: there is still a huge gender gap in the entrepreneurial scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are not enough women among us entrepreneurs, and the ones that are out there are getting less credit, recognition, investment and opportunities than their men counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for all of us, in the last years, a lot of new initiatives have been started to raise awareness at any level: every person deserves to be treated equally in society, regardless of their gender. We very much believe so at Startup Grind, and we are committed to raising awareness in our own sector, where we are strong, that is: among entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really disheartening that in the 21st century we still have this problem in our society. Let’s right this wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last March, we announced that Startup Grind passed the 200 Chapters mark worldwide. One of the most recent additions is really close to Barcelona, actually. It’s in Tenerife. So I’m happy to count on another Chapter in the Southern Europe region that I get to help in as a Regional Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back on topic: 200 chapters worldwide that will host a female speaker during this month. Isn’t that incredible? Yet a lot more can be done: we need to be hosting more female speakers every month, outside of these initiatives, and, of course, foster entrepreneurship among women so we won’t run out of female speakers too fast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Barcelona, we will host &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/maralarco&quot; title=&quot;Mar Alarcón on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mar Alarcón&lt;/a&gt; (CEO @ SocialCar). Mar created &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.socialcar.com/&quot; title=&quot;SocialCar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SocialCar&lt;/a&gt; to help people to monetise their cars while they are not being used, and went for many years without external investment. This is incredible nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mar is also an expert on sharing economy, so we will be talking about other sharing economy apps like Uber, AirBnB or direct competitors such as Drivy, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is going to take place on May 19th at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobileworldcentre.com&quot; title=&quot;Mobile World Centre&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mobile World Centre&lt;/a&gt; and it’s going to be conducted in Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Ideal RAGE Acoustic Setlist</title>

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/05/08/My-ideal-Rage-acoustic-setlist</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160508.jpg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160508.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Peavy Wagner of RAGE&quot; alt=&quot;Peavy Wagner of RAGE&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; RAGE, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated metal bands ever. Period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rage-official.com/&quot; title=&quot;RAGE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bochum-based band RAGE&lt;/a&gt; has been spearheading German metal for well over three decades already. I got to know them in 2002 when they released &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/3YTD0WNB0epEbpenQmkvBL&quot; title=&quot;Unity by RAGE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt;, at the peak of their career, with one of the most solid power trios ever known in the metal scene: guitar virtuoso Victor Smolski, the almighty Mike Terrana on drums and Peavy Wagner as the mastermind of the band, on bass guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity, for many, was a ground-breaking album that pushed the limits of what we’d call “metal”. While it wasn’t the hardest, fastest or most extreme album ever, it blended perfectly the classical heavy metal with rather uncommon guitar distortions, catchy choruses &lt;i&gt;à la&lt;/i&gt; punk rock style, a bluesy-meets-neoclassical guitar soloing vibe and, most important, the solidity and heavyness that only such talented musicians could bring to life while being just that: only three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before they published the sequel to Unity that would consolidate Rage on the elite of European metal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/14VCfG1AEfnBlHWdtJi7au&quot; title=&quot;Soundchaser, by RAGE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Soundchaser&lt;/a&gt;, I listened to their previous albums and quickly became a huge fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the non-metalheads in the room, I reckon RAGE is a very appropriate band to start listening to metal. In their more than 20 albums they have touched almost every variation of the genre (except the extremes: black, death, etc.) while flirting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/10AJiE4tF8BVjikUJJT885&quot; title=&quot;Lingua Mortis Orchestra by RAGE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;classical music&lt;/a&gt; or more poppy melodic metal like &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/album/5AAVSRsuRdUJyyqLkOO9uo&quot; title=&quot;_target&quot;&gt;Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back on topic: I am a huge fan of versions. I spend lots of time watching and listening to concerts just to hear different versions of the same song. Some of my favourite songs happen to be the acoustic version of a band’s most acclaimed song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although RAGE have never toured doing only acoustic stuff, and I hope they never do, I would like to see a concert or two just with acoustic versions of the following songs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I selected the 21 RAGE songs that I think they would make good acoustic stuff and that I like the most! Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All this time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In Vain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Incomplete&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ghosts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Mirror in Your Eyes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the Page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Great Old Ones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sent by the Devil&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t Fear the Winter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;French Bourrée&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fading Hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beauty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vanished in Haze&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Falling From Grace: Part 1 Wake the Nightmares&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All I Want&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Days of December&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shame on You&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enough is Enough&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set this World on Fire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back in Time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Higher than the Sky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine the concert would start with easy songs, mostly ballads, since it’s an acoustic concert. That’s true for the first four songs. Or five, as I guess that &lt;i&gt;The Mirror in Your Eyes&lt;/i&gt; would make an excellent ballad if they ever decided to record an acoustic version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they would speed up with &lt;i&gt;Turn the Page, Great Old Ones, Sent by the Devil&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Don’t Fear the Winter&lt;/i&gt; before slowly returning to the calm with &lt;i&gt;French Bourrée&lt;/i&gt;, which would introduce the ballads moment until &lt;i&gt;Falling From Grace&lt;/i&gt; would kick in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this point on, it’s mostly classics and sing-along songs with catchy choruses, peaking at &lt;i&gt;Set this World on Fire&lt;/i&gt; and one of my all-time favourites &lt;i&gt;Back in Time&lt;/i&gt; before wrapping it up with the typical show-closer &lt;i&gt;Higher than the Sky&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would really fly to virtually anywhere in the world to see this concert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have actually created a Spotify playlist with the originals, so you can actually get a first impression of how it would sound like. You can listen to it &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/user/alex.rodba/playlist/6nG2H4qJ2jFDFEC0JFKiK5&quot; title=&quot;RAGE playlist on Spotify&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treat yourself to some RAGE and rock on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Playing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1fsjNbPFGuR7hK6euWuHd4&quot; title=&quot;RAGE - Set this World on Fire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-spotify&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; RAGE - Set this World on Fire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adding 'Minutes to read' to your Jekyll blog</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/04/24/Adding-minutes-to-read-to-your-jekyll-blog.html" />
      <updated>2016-04-24T22:13:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/04/24/Adding-minutes-to-read-to-your-jekyll-blog</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160424.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160424.png&quot; title=&quot;Reading&quot; alt=&quot;Reading&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; I created a code snippet to calculate reading time on a given blog post for Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got this idea from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medium.com&quot; title=&quot;Medium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;’s interface, where you can see each post’s reading time, as you can see below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160424medium.png&quot; title=&quot;Medium reading time&quot; alt=&quot;Medium reading time&quot; class=&quot;fit image border&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Medium, as elegant as ever.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found online a basic snippet of code that runs like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; • {% capture words %}
      {{ page.content | number_of_words | minus: 180 }}
    {% endcapture %}
    {% unless words contains &quot;-&quot; %}
      {% words | plus: 180 | divided_by: 180 | append: &quot; minutes to read.&quot; %}
    {% endunless %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the snippet above does not differentiate between singular and plural, and if the number of minutes is 1, it writes “1 minute&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; to read”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I added a little bit more of logic to differentiate between the two cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt; • {% capture words %}
      {{ page.content | number_of_words | minus: 180 }}
   {% endcapture %}
   {% unless words contains &quot;-&quot; %}
     {% assign minutes = words | plus: 180 | divided_by: 180 %}
        {{ minutes }}
     {% if minutes == 1 %}
        {{ &quot; minute to read.&quot; }}
     {% else %}
        {{ &quot; minutes to read.&quot; }}
     {% endif %}
   {% endunless %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to do it in a simpler way taking advantage of Liquid’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid/filters/string-filters#pluralize&quot; title=&quot;Liquid pluralize filter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Liquid’s ‘pluralize’ tag&lt;/a&gt; but it doesn’t seem to work, for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep things more organised, create a file named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post-readingtime.erb&lt;/code&gt; including this code snippet and save it in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; folder. Then, go to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post.html&lt;/code&gt; file and call it like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160424snippet.png&quot; title=&quot;Medium reading time&quot; alt=&quot;Medium reading time&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that was useful! If you happen to have why is ‘pluralize’ not working well here, let me know in the comments section below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Playing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/1k7J4dLtVMP1YnlMcTbYn4&quot; title=&quot;Manel - Un directiu em va acomiadar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-spotify&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Manel - Un directiu em va acomiadar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Syndicate Old Blog Posts in Jekyll without Screwing Your SEO</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/04/19/Syndicate-Old-Blog-Posts-in-Jekyll-Without-Screwing-Your-SEO.html" />

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/04/19/Syndicate-Old-Blog-Posts-in-Jekyll-Without-Screwing-Your-SEO</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160419.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160419.png&quot; title=&quot;Fire&quot; alt=&quot;Fire&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; There’s no clear explanation on the Internet on how to do this properly, so I built my own solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who know me well will be tired of hearing me say all the time that &lt;strong&gt;if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem&lt;/strong&gt;. I’m a firm believer of this conviction and I say it all the time. Most likely, when I die, I will have that written on my tombstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been learning marketing on my own for the past years, and most of what I have found is that marketers tend to exaggerate A LOT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketers like to sell their expertise on things that are, in most of the cases, just common sense. That’s it, I dropped the bomb, but I stand firmly by this affirmation. And while I still haven’t accomplished anything too big, marketing-wise, I must say I am fairly content with what I’ve done with both &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many studies, so many rules, so many theories, workshops, webinars and astrology about SEO and no one has quite figured out how to syndicate old blog posts correctly. That is the case of this very blog which I started in late March 2016. I want to aggregate here all the blog posts I’ve produced for MarsBased, Startup Grind, Barcelona Ventures and other sites I’ve written for throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would have been simple if we were not talking about risking a Google penalty for content duplication! Serious stuff here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how are we supposed to syndicate our own old stuff into a new site?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution-part-1-the-tech-stuff&quot;&gt;The Solution Part 1: The Tech Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclaimer, if you came for the SEO stuff, skip this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I am going to describe how I implemented this in Jekyll, my static site generator of choice. And yours, if you’re right about stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to assume you know how to run a blog on Jekyll and that you’ve got basic coding skills. No rocket science required, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, we add a new set of variables called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;original&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll Front Matter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jekyll front matter&lt;/a&gt;, such as the one highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160419frontmatter.png&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll Front Matter&quot; alt=&quot;Jekyll Front Matter&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have all sorts of useful variables there, but let’s focus on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;original&lt;/code&gt;. You can either write it yourself, or you can copy them from here (make sure you respect the indentation):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;original:
  link: https://medium.com/@lexrodba/i-love-telling-stories-97367d98caf1#.6hipt2gsc
  date: 2014-12-11
  site: Medium
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means that we have a variable called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;original&lt;/code&gt; that includes three other variables that I describe here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;link&lt;/strong&gt;: Contains the URL of the original post or content.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;date&lt;/strong&gt;: Contains the original post or content’s publishing date.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;site&lt;/strong&gt;: Contains the name of the site where the post or content was published.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will create a file named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post-original.erb&lt;/code&gt; under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; folder with the following content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;page.original&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;include.param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;'header'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;elsif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;include.param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;'body'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file basically means &lt;i&gt;if the blog post has got the ‘original’ variable set (that means, it’s a syndicated post) and output HTML according to the parameter that will be passed on during the call&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why this? Well, I wanted to group the logic in a simple file, instead of calling two different files. We will call this file twice per post, once in the header and once after the content. More details in the marketing section below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you will locate the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts/posts.html&lt;/code&gt; and add the two calls that you see in the snippet below. As mentioned above, one in the header and one after the content, with its corresponding parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160419calls.png&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll SEO stuff&quot; alt=&quot;Jekyll SEO stuff&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customize to your heart’s content from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-solution-part-2-the-marketing-stuff&quot;&gt;The Solution Part 2: The Marketing Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the basics: Google does not approve of duplicated content. What’s more: if they find out you duplicate content, they can potentially penalise you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the best way to avoid being penalised for duplicating content? Obviously, it is &lt;strong&gt;not duplicating content&lt;/strong&gt; if you want to play it 100% safe. However, if you really need to do it and are a little adventurous yourself, then follow me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most marketers will agree that you should never publish using the old date. Even if you’re re-posting stuff, you should do it using today’s time, linking back to the original post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screw that: even if Google uses bots to crawl the sites, your visitors are humans. Use common sense to make their life easier and their experience more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous section we developed a plugin that will add the following two crucial code snippets to your reused blog post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rel=canonical&lt;/code&gt; metatag in the header.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A written reference to the original post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is a hidden reference to the original post using a metatag. Metatags don’t show up to visitors, but stay hidden in the source code, hence being readable by bots &amp;amp; crawlers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this metatag better, I suggest you read these two articles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en&quot; title=&quot;Google's explanation of canonical URLs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google’s explanation of canonical URLs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/learn/seo/canonicalization&quot; title=&quot;Canonicalization by Moz.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canonicalization, by Moz.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hidden code snippet will appear like this in your source code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160419canonical.png&quot; title=&quot;Canonical link&quot; alt=&quot;Canonical link&quot; class=&quot;fit image border&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;HTML code output.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second code snippet is a written reference to the original content, and will appear visibly at the end of the content. Both the visitor and the crawler will understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160419reference.png&quot; title=&quot;Canonical link&quot; alt=&quot;Canonical link&quot; class=&quot;fit image border&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Simple and elegant.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, we have developed a solution that’s both functional and elegant and will let you syndicate old stuff in your site without having SEO issues or incurring into penalisations because of content duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if I accidentally skipped anything in the comments section below or what have you done to solve this problem before reading this!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Give Yourself a Head Start on the Week by Gearing up on Sunday Evenings</title>

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/04/17/Give-Yourself-A-Head-Start-On-The-Week-By-Gearing-Up-On-Sunday-Evenings</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160417post.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160417post.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Gears&quot; alt=&quot;Gears&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; No, this blog entry isn’t about working during the weekend to be more productive. On the contrary: start early to finish earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read all too often that being an entrepreneur and owning a startup is about &lt;i&gt;hustling&lt;/i&gt;, working 24/7, always thinking about business and other exaggerations. Oftentimes, I have also read that the weekly grind absorbs you so much that you’ve got to work on the weekend to be able to be more creative and free from too many notifications or external distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-should-work-when-you-feel-most-active&quot;&gt;You should work when you feel most active&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, for one, tend to spread my working hours along the day and the week. It makes no matter whether today is Sunday and I am writing a blog. If I work today, I probably have slacked off during the week at a given point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t conceive entrepreneurship, or owning a business &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt;, as something so demanding as to make me work 24/7. That’s a rookie mistake we all have done when we started. We think we always need to work more and stretch the hours to meet the goals and deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, as a matter of fact, short-sighted. By working longer shifts and being “always active” you increase the risk of burnout and the quality of what you produce will decrease dramatically. Think long-term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my rule: &lt;strong&gt;work when your body tells you to, rest when your body tells you to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you might think: the more I rest, the more I want to get back to work, the better stuff I produce, and thus the more satisfied I am at the end of the day. Rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-advantage-of-your-flexibility&quot;&gt;Take advantage of your flexibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conceived &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marsbased.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; as a distributed team from the very start. One of my partners, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/jordi_vendrell&quot; title=&quot;Jordi Vendrell on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jordi&lt;/a&gt; lives in Balaguer, deep in the Catalan countryside, and I travel a lot. Why should we need an office when we were only three and only our other partner - the CTO - would be in it all day? What a waste of resources!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two years, we are ten people strong and we still do not own an office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We truly believe that by allowing our employees to choose when they want to work and where they want to work from we would boost their happiness. Well-rested and happy workers produce better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I do take advantage of this situation all the time: I fly on regular weekdays to find cheaper tickets and then compensate during the weekend, for instance. Or else, I take half a day off because I need to solve a family issue and I don’t really care about putting extra hours if my weekly goals have been met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My regular schedule is weird, but it works wonders for me: I wake up around 10 or 11am, work for a couple hours (mostly meetings) then I go to the gym when it’s less crowded, between 1 and 3PM. I work while I eat well past 3PM (business lunches or else I write/read stuff) and then - if my agenda allows me - I take a power nap (under 20 minutes). I resume work at about 4 or 5PM and then work until my body tells me to stop. No pressure on counting the hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line here is that &lt;i&gt;working more does not mean performing better&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-tip-for-productivity-dont-waste-the-weekend-away&quot;&gt;A tip for productivity: don’t waste the weekend away&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I don’t cherish the idea of working on weekends, I find that Sunday afternoons &amp;amp; evenings are ideal to work and get a head start on the week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sundays are oftentimes lazy days that you spend slacking off on the couch.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nothing’s open, nothing works.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you work, no one will interrupt you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emails sent on Sunday will be placed on top of the recipient’s inbox on Monday morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are just some advantages of putting in two or three hours on Sunday afternoons. I mostly use it to plan the week ahead and send some critical emails. I also use them to finish stuff I left on Friday because I was too tired and needed to recharge batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But above all, if I work on Sundays is because I want to leave early on Friday afternoons and start the weekend a little bit earlier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reckon this advice is not for everyone, but I hope you found it useful and that you will share your productivity tips in the comment sections below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Here's What's Broken in Followup.cc</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/04/15/Heres-Whats-Broken-in-Followupcc.html" />
      <updated>2016-04-15T23:27:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/04/15/Heres-Whats-Broken-in-Followupcc</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160415post.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160415post.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Broken car&quot; alt=&quot;Broken car&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; I have been using FollowUp.cc for months and I think it’s a great product, but it’s got three major issues that need to be solved ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those into sales, you know that following up with your sales prospects &amp;amp; leads is one crucial task that requires a lot of attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Business developers like myself, or sales people &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; need to track dozens, if not hundreds, of deals over the course of the week. And, while in the past this was tracked down manually with a lot of diligence and dedication, nowadays we have got tools to automate this process and help us to deliver a better customer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been using Evernote’s reminders in the past until I found a dedicated tool for this: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.followup.cc&quot; title=&quot;FollowUp.cc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FollowUp.cc&lt;/a&gt;. FollowUp.cc is a great tool that helps you to set reminders and automated responses for your email, and after using their free testing period, I decided to go for the yearly subscription, which I gladly paid upfront after a very good first experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidence or not, the product started to break almost right after paying the yearly subscription. I found some bugs that might only happen to me, but I’d like to share them here so someone else can find about them and not feel alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-features-disappear-or-behave-randomly&quot;&gt;Some features disappear or behave randomly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FollowUp.cc is a Chrome plugin you install and give access to your email to get extended controls over your inbox. You probably used similar plugins such as Streak, Mailtrack or Better Gmail in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing with Followup.cc is that it disappears randomly, sometimes in the middle of an email, thus forcing you to reload the Gmail interface to get it back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is not entirely disturbing, it’s kind of inconvenient because it happens randomly and you cannot anticipate when it’s going to happen nor try to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it does not disappear entirely, but it &lt;i&gt;folds&lt;/i&gt; its sidebar so it cannot be unfolded. I actually recorded one video to see what’s happening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3Bjx54kc1s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sidebar contains the settings, information about whether the emails have been read, integration with Salesforce and other useful stuff. Sometimes I can open it, sometimes I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, in Followup.cc, there’s an option to snooze an email. If you snooze an email, the app archives it for a given period of time. However, my experience has been different every time: sometimes the email gets archived, sometimes it doesn’t. You can’t predict it, and I actually haven’t tracked whether it bounces back to the inbox when it should or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160415postsnooze.png&quot; title=&quot;Followup.cc's email notifications&quot; alt=&quot;Followup.cc's email notifications&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which might actually be the cause for the next issue…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;im-getting-notifications-for-random-emails&quot;&gt;I’m getting notifications for random emails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous errors are understandable because I might have conflicting plugins, a conflicting Gmail inbox setup or other stuff interfering with FollowUp.cc’s own nature. Every software breaks every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this thing is absolutely wrong: I started getting reminders for emails I had never set a reminder for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160415post2.png&quot; title=&quot;Followup.cc's email notifications&quot; alt=&quot;Followup.cc's email notifications&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See? This email was sent in 2014. I didn’t have Followup.cc set up back then. Heck, I am not even sure FollowUp.cc existed yet. Why would I dig this email up and set a reminder for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess was that the snoozing feature sometimes didn’t select the right email, assigning the reminder to older emails. So I decided to stop using it and, much to my dismay, these random emails kept popping up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means the reminder you set when sending an email might not be functioning well. I mean, the one you set down here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160415postreminder.png&quot; title=&quot;Followup.cc's email notifications&quot; alt=&quot;Followup.cc's email notifications&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, I found really disappointing and terrible for my business. I might have missed out on important emails because the right notifications/reminders haven’t reached me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stand the idea of losing deals because of a broken product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;their-support-team-is-really-slow&quot;&gt;Their support team is really slow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is technically not a bug, but as a paying customer, I think I ought to have received a better treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a developer, so I like to report broken stuff and offer all sorts of information to help other developers to fix their bugs. I try my best to submit all the information I can such as the browser I am using, its version, some screenshots, steps to reproduce the bugs and lately, thanks to Screen-o-matic, also videos - like the one I showed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started finding bugs, I emailed FollowUp.cc’s support team to offer help and report the issues. Most of the times no one replied, and when they did it was because &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; followed up, but they replied almost always more than two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some emails went unnoticed and unreplied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160415postsupport.png&quot; title=&quot;Followup.cc's email notifications&quot; alt=&quot;Followup.cc's email notifications&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I eventually became frustrated, angered and disappointed. I also wrote this email above behaving like an ass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand that things break, but your core functionality cannot be broken for that long. And, at least, try to give me some feedback if I write complaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this text might sound, I did not write it out of spite or malice. I just wanted to share my mistake of being too over-excited about something that was not ready yet and I should not have paid a year upfront for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: The Followup.cc guys have actually written back and refunded me, being nice and attentive. I hope they get the love, attention, and resources they need to get back to the quality standards they should meet and that they finally succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160412post.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412post.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; If you’re reading this, it might mean you’re thinking about attending the Startup Grind Barcelona second anniversary event. You don’t want to miss this very special event. Here’s what’s in for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-basics&quot;&gt;Some basics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Startup Grind, we do a monthly event where I interview an entrepreneur, but this event is special: it commemorates our first two years in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m4yMTi67KY&amp;amp;list=PLJ81xh1c0JYC0Lj_iaGq7KKZvP31qoLOC&amp;amp;nohtml5=False&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona fireside chat with Marc Vicente&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;April 2014 with Marc Vicente (ex-CEO of Rakuten Spain)&lt;/a&gt;, and we have hosted an event consistently month after month. You can see all our past events in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. Month after month, and that means 24 months in a row, we have hosted a 100-person event at Mobile World Center mostly, but not exclusively. Sometimes we held the event at Barcelona Activa or at Itnig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, because the event is so special, we will do it at Antiga Fàbrica Estrella Damm (C/Roselló, 515), like our First Anniversary Event. It’s a wonderful venue, you can see it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1202327503115806.1073741850.831234583558435&amp;amp;type=3&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind BCN first anniversary event&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the pictures of our First Anniversary Event&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event is going to be conducted in English, which is something that we have been testing this year, and it seems to have a very positive response, and the event will run between 18.30 and 22.30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are charging 10 euros to cover the running expenses of the event: photographers, transport, food, material and other unplanned (and oftentimes unpleasant) surprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me detail what you will find at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-hour-community-hour&quot;&gt;First hour: community hour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you will arrive, you will meet a room with 200 people. There will be the Startup Grind team, our sponsors and partners, the speaker, entrepreneurs, VIPs, and mostly friends you haven’t met yet, if you allow me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412welcome.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; We will welcome you in a very cozy and warm ambience, with some music, while we wait for the rest of the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first hour of the event is always devoted to putting our entrepreneurs in the spotlight. You are so important to us, and this is our way to pay it back to you. In fact, our speaker is always in the first hour in the middle of the audience, among you all, to listen to your projects and watch the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what we did last year, and what we will do this year, in our Anniversary Event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412carlos.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Carlos (the handsome bearded guy in the picture) will welcome you all and conduct the Open Mic session, where we will select ten entrepreneurs that will come on stage and ask for help for their projects. Each entrepreneur has got only one minute to do it! If they go over that minute, we massively boo at them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412openmic.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Doing the Open Mic, we can showcase some of the coolest projects in Barcelona, and the networking part is more driven. They get to also practice their pitch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right after that, we will have our CEO Derek Andersen say some words to the audience. Full disclaimer: last year they included bald jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412derek.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event and Derek Andersen&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event and Derek Andersen&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means a lot to us: we are connecting to Silicon Valley, where Startup Grind originated, and we prove the global reach this huge network has. Anytime we want, we’ve got a friend in over 200 cities in 80 different countries willing to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite leading the biggest network of entrepreneurs ever, Derek has always time for everyone. He’s a fairly accessible person despite his status and has got good words for every single soul out there. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/derekjandersen&quot; title=&quot;Derek Andersen on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweet at him&lt;/a&gt; to ask him stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412sponsors.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event keynote of BCN Startup Map by Xavier Dumont of Barcelona Activa&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event keynote of BCN Startup Map by Xavier Dumont of Barcelona Activa&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Derek’s speech, we will get back to Barcelona and offer some time to our sponsors. But, fear not! They’re not there to talk about boring stuff or give institutional messages: they know our values, and they will show how they Connect, Educate and Inspire entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for now, we only have got one sponsor: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.haufe.com&quot; title=&quot;Haufe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Haufe&lt;/a&gt;. Haufe is a company that focuses on talent management and recruitment that is expanding to Barcelona, where they are creating a nearshoring development team. Therefore, if you’re looking for a new job, make sure you bring business cards or your CV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haufe, and the rest of sponsors (if we have them), will give valuable content to you in their keynotes and will stay from beginning to end to meet you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412keynote.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event keynote by Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event keynote by Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, I will wrap the first hour by giving a keynote where I will share some stats with you, review our first two years of Startup Grind in Barcelona, and lots of funny cat pictures. And memes. Lots of memes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-hour-fireside-chat&quot;&gt;Second hour: fireside chat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fireside chat - an informal interview - is the trademark of Startup Grind. If you have attended any of our events, you will know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the fireside chats, I am interviewing a famous person, mostly entrepreneurs, but we have also hosted investors, marketers and corporate people. As long as they share our values and want to spend some time meeting us all by sharing their experiences from the stage, we will welcome to the Startup Grind family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412firesidechat.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event fireside chat with Miguel Vicente&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event fireside chat with Miguel Vicente&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good example of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGw9njGcfyg&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona fireside chat with Jordi Miró (CTO of Wuaki.tv)&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fireside chat I did with Jordi Miró (CTO at Wuaki.tv)&lt;/a&gt;, and you can find the rest of our fireside chats in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m4yMTi67KY&amp;amp;list=PLJ81xh1c0JYC0Lj_iaGq7KKZvP31qoLOC&amp;amp;nohtml5=False&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona Youtube channel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fireside chats last for about 45 minutes, followed by 15 minutes of questions &amp;amp; answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this Second Anniversary event, we will host Iñaki Ecenarro, ex-CEO and founder of Trovit, the most famous search engine for classified ads from Spain, which is now operating in 46 countries. Iñaki sold the company to NEXT Group in 2014 for 80M€.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, one year and a half past, Iñaki is looking for a new challenge. Maybe you can help him find it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-hour-networking-dinner-and-beers&quot;&gt;Third hour: networking, dinner, and beers!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We typically wrap up the event with a good session of quality networking, where we serve catering and cold beverages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412networking.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we are at Estrella Damm headquarters, who not only lend us kindly one of the coolest venues in town, but they will also offer our attendees all sorts of beers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for dinner, our sponsors will help cover the costs, so thanks again to Haufe for being so kind and helping us out. Buying dinner for 200 people is not precisely cheap, but for such an important event, and as a reward for spending so many hours with us, we want to thank you by filling your belly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, drinking with an empty stomach isn’t what we’d call a &lt;i&gt;best practice&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160412networking2.png&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona First Anniversary Event&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the networking part, we will have a DJ to mix things up, and you will be able to greet &amp;amp; thank our sponsors in their booths, mingle with like-minded people, ask Iñaki more personal questions and network with past speakers and other VIPs from the Barcelona entrepreneurial scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find this and much more next Thursday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I’ve changed your mind and that you will join us! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/startup-grind-bcn-2nd-anniversary-with-inaki-ecenarro-ex-trovit-tickets-23854280796&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona Second Event&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get your tickets while they last NOW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Come on Vueling, we can still be friends</title>

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/04/10/Come-on-Vueling-we-can-still-be-friends</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160410post.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160410post.png&quot; title=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; alt=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Six months ago I wrote this, but decided not to publish it. However, after yet another unfortunate event with Vueling, I decided they deserved to be called out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sit down. Here, here. We need to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not me. It’s you. And we need to talk about it before it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember five years ago? Does the name &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull&quot; title=&quot;Eyjafjallajökull entry on Wikipedia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eyjafjallajökull&lt;/a&gt; ring a bell? It’s not about her. I’m not into volcanos anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, I was flying from Greece to Barcelona, with a stopover in Milano Malpensa. My flight was scheduled to depart at 21.00 and arrive in Barcelona at 22.30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of an air-traffic controller strike in France, our flight could not leave, and we suffered a delay of five hours and a half — we left at 1.30. I made it home at about 4.30 in the morning. Considering I had to wake up at 7.00 to go to work (yes, it was a Wednesday), I felt pretty bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had arrived at 22.30 I would have taken public transportation and be home for less than 2 euros. Instead, I had to take a cab and pay about 50. I also would’ve slept before going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Milan, there was nobody giving explanations while we helplessly saw how other flights (more expensive, so maybe they could afford being re-routed through a southern route) were departing with no problems. Our flight, however, stayed. And there was nobody to talk to. The airport people told us to complain to the Vueling staff, which were nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I filed a complaint asking for, at least, the compensation of the taxi price. All I received from you was an “&lt;i&gt;I’m sorry. I will not do it again&lt;/i&gt;”. You can check the flight number (VY6335) for October 12th, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s ok. I think I deserved better, but this is how relationships work: once you win, once you lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there until now it’s been a problem after another. You’ve been sometimes late, your mobile app is nothing short of useless (I have to input the reservation number and the airport every time for the flights I already have? Seriously?), sometimes I receive the boarding passes — while others I don’t and I must go to the counter — not to talk about the service on board. But hey, I have never complained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a patient man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also remember the good times we had when I took part in your first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bizmatchbyvueling.com/boarding/&quot; title=&quot;Bizmatch by Vueling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Business on Board&lt;/a&gt; last year, going to Milan (coincidence?) and back. It was a fun ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But two big fuckups in such a short time are enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-fuckup-losing-my-luggage&quot;&gt;First fuckup: losing my luggage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had for the first time in my life bought an Excellence ticket to come back from Mykonos at 6am in the morning. I never buy “business class” tickets but this time the difference was not big, and I thought to myself “hey, after a month in Greece, and being so early, I might as well go with something more comfortable”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only I found it useless: speed boarding only valid for Spain, VIP areas only in Barcelona and I didn’t get anything extra besides the extra snacks. I also felt something was going to go real bad when they told me I could check in my hand luggage for free, which I kindly refused, as I know that means it’s going on a different flight. The staff there forced me to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Little surprise: I arrived in Barcelona, and guess what? My luggage was not there. Some other people’s luggage were lost as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost three days of work because of that (my hard drive was there, plus some USB sticks and material I needed to work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the ordeal I had to go through to get my luggage back:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They messaged me that I would receive my luggage in the next 48h (that means, stay home for 48h).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I host a business event called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/a&gt; once a month and — guess what — the luggage had to arrive in the middle of my event.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I called to see if they could come back later, they told me they couldn’t, but I could go myself to pick it somewhere convenient to the driver (!!!), which I eventually did.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Only one of the two suitcases was there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The second one arrived without notice two days after. It was by pure chance I was home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Filed a complaint: never got an answer. Tried several complaint companies, none helped because the case was too complex &amp;amp; small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-fuckup-cant-change-a-flight&quot;&gt;Second fuckup: can’t change a flight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one really has forced me to publish this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I booked a flight for a friend’s party in Hamburg. Turns out, the event was happening later in the month. My bad: it’s OK, I’ll pay the fee and I’ll change the booking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not with Vueling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160410post2.png&quot; title=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; alt=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Translation: 'dear client, fuck you'.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really, that literally translates to “&lt;i&gt;With Vueling, you can change the date and time of your flight up until two hours before the departure. We give you all the flexibility you need!&lt;/i&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flexibility? Let’s see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160410post3.png&quot; title=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; alt=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;OH THE FLEXIBILITY&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days before &amp;amp; after the booked departure. That is “&lt;i&gt;all the flexibility you need&lt;/i&gt;” according to Vueling. Way to go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the website, you can call their center or send them a message, both of which I did do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phone:&lt;/strong&gt; all lines busy, long waiting, sending from one person to the other. All of this, being charged. Of course, they offer no free number. Nothing solved in the end. I am a busy man, can’t stay one hour hanging by the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message:&lt;/strong&gt; I sent them an email asking for two things: how can I change a flight to dates I can’t select through the website and a free Customer Care phone number.
Two days after, I received this worthless email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160410post4.png&quot; title=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; alt=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Translation: 'dear client, fuck you'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a generic email, with the information that’s on the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not ask you to write my name in the email, nor that you wish me a good day or that you’re really sorry about what happened and that you’ll try to help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just fucking shoved me the FAQ content in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vueling did not even attempt to answer my question, nor did they include the free number I asked for. They didn’t even read my complaint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lies-lies-lies&quot;&gt;Lies, lies, lies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to cancel my booking, which I am entitled to, provided I pay a cancellation fee. Vueling says that you cannot cancel your booking so you dismiss the idea of issuing a complaint, which is a blatant lie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read this (in Spanish): &lt;a href=&quot;http://legal.practicopedia.lainformacion.com/reclamaciones/como-devolver-un-billete-de-avion-y-recuperar-tu-dinero-15656&quot; title=&quot;Cómo devolver un billete de avión y recuperar tu dinero&quot;&gt;Como devolver un billete de avión y recuperar tu dinero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160410post5.png&quot; title=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; alt=&quot;Come on Vueling, we can still be friends&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;This is Vueling’s cancellation policy. Spanish for: 'dear client, fuck you'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. I thought we could still be friends, but it’s not me: it’s you. We’re through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To most of you this picture might make no sense. For some of us, it means a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I belonged to ESN for almost four years of my life. &lt;a href=&quot;http://esn.org/&quot; title=&quot;ESN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erasmus Student Network&lt;/a&gt; is a global network of exchange students associations that has a section in each university in a lot of different cities all over Europe. It’s all about students helping other students, where we volunteered to help others have a wonderful experience when they come to our country or city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, I began my ESN experience in Munich, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.international.tum.de/willkommen-an-der-tum/internationale-austauschstudierende/tuminternational/&quot; title=&quot;TUMi München&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TUMi&lt;/a&gt;, and then co-founded &lt;a href=&quot;http://esnupf.org/&quot; title=&quot;ESN UPF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ESN UPF&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona with some friends (four of them are in this picture, among which, the Startup Grind Barcelona team members Carlos Cruz and Pol Canela).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost four years after quitting ESN and moving on, I find myself surrounded by a lot of the friends I made at ESN. Some of whom are part of Startup Grind, my new family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one way or another, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/a&gt; and ESN have a lot in common, but this is not what I wanted to express.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, an ESN bus had an accident on the road, coming back from Valencia. What should’ve been an amazing day for those students, turned into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35855850&quot; title=&quot;13 Erasmus girls dead on the road in Spain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a nightmare which costed the lives of 13 girls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We thought we’d pay homage from our new family to the old one by proudly sporting an ESN t-shirt during our last Startup Grind event in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, at the end of every event, the Startup Grind Barcelona team members take a picture with the guest speaker. This time, I invited everyone in the audience that had been part of ESN (except for one, too shy to come). That’s right: 8 ex-ESNrs. Isn’t that cool?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not much, but it definitely felt like the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay strong. We are one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Do</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/27/What-I-Do.html" />

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/27/What-I-Do</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160327post.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160327post.png&quot; title=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit at Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; alt=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit at Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Here’s a status update of what I do today, by March 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an obstinate and results-oriented entrepreneur that likes to challenge the status quo. As a result of that, I sometimes spend too much working on what I love and too little communicating clearly what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my new year's resolutions is to blog more. In addition to leading the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com/blog/&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lexrodba&quot; title=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit on Medium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my personal Medium account&lt;/a&gt;, and contributing to &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupgrind.com&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind's blog&lt;/a&gt;, I opened this website to write about &lt;i&gt;anything and everything&lt;/i&gt;. Practice makes the master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let me explain what I do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, my best friends and I founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;, a development consultancy that focused on good code, specialisation, best practices and long-term relationships. That is, quality, not price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We faced two fundamental problems: Firstly, Spain is a country whose people opt, in 99% of the cases, for the cheapest option. Secondly, we had to compete against jack-of-all-trades companies that sell one-size-fits-all solutions based mostly on Wordpress, Drupal and pre-packaged CMS solutions that never adapt 100% to what the client requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years in, we are 10 people strong with clients in three different continents. Alive and kicking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, two years ago I brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/a&gt; to Barcelona, a global community of entrepreneurs hosting monthly events in 200 cities in over 80 different countries. &quot;&lt;i&gt;No one has time for more events&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;i&gt;no one will pay for an event about startups&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;i&gt;monthly events do not work&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;i&gt;Catalans are cheap people&lt;/i&gt;&quot; and similar sentences I had to confront daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years in, we have hosted &lt;i&gt;at least&lt;/i&gt; one paid event every month for 24 consecutive months with an average attendance of almost 100 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is important to you, you will find a way. If not, you’ll find an excuse - Anonymous&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Dank je wel, Johan</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/25/Dank-je-wel-Johan.html" />

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/25/Dank-je-wel-Johan</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160325post.jpg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160325post.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Johan Cryuff playing for FC Barcelona, photo courtesy of Goal.com&quot; alt=&quot;Johan Cryuff playing for FC Barcelona, photo courtesy of Goal.com&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; I never met you, Johan, but you were everywhere for most of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first conscious childhood memories I have got is related to football. I was five, and not into football at that time because my life revolved around Micro Machines, Transformers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. This story takes place on May, 20th, in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night marked a turning point in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fcbarcelona.es/&quot; title=&quot;FC Barcelona website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Football Club Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;’s history: the club won their first European Championship in their almost 100 years of existence thanks to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICOxLbWJkS8&quot; title=&quot;Ronald Koeman Wembley final goal 1992&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;impressive strike by Ronald Koeman&lt;/a&gt;. FC Barcelona was then managed by Johan Cruyff, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/24/johan-cruyff-dies-aged-68-holland-football-legend&quot; title=&quot;Johan Cruyff Dead at 68&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;died yesterday at age 68&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was playing with my toys right after dinner, my whole family was watching that historical game as if there were no tomorrow. When Koeman scored in the extra time, an explosion of joy &amp;amp; cheering could be heard all over the house. It was so loud, it woke up my cousin, who was barely two years old at the time, and I remember him crying while the rest of the family was dancing and crying from the emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t understand what was going on. But I soon learnt that there was more than a team winning a competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;johan-changed-the-team-forever&quot;&gt;1. Johan changed the team forever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johan Cruyff was at the time the coach of FC Barcelona, having previously been one of the star players during the 70s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, he led the team, both as a player and as a coach, in the two most successful periods of the teams history. We grudgingly admit that we had always been Spain’s second team, after arch-rivals Real Madrid, except for these periods, where Barcelona reigned thanks to the influence of Cruyff’s skills as a player and methods as a coach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stemming from the Dutch school, he introduced the culture of ball keeping and possession game, whereby - as he put it - &lt;i&gt;if you’ve got the ball, the opponent cannot score&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has become FC Barcelona’s trademark and playbook up until now and created a new breed of players that wouldn’t have otherwise been successful such as Guardiola, Xavi, Iniesta and Messi. Quite the coincidence, our best players recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guardiola, the best coach we have ever had, admitted that he owes all his successes to Cruyff’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;johan-changed-the-country&quot;&gt;2. Johan changed the country&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much to some people’s dismay, FC Barcelona has been the representation of the Catalan culture at an international level. Almost like our national team, going beyond borders and ideologies, without excluding anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By turning the team into a winning one, this inspired the rest of the country in turn. We used to live in constant defeat, whereas now we know we’re capable of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johan also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espnfc.com/blog/espn-fc-united-blog/68/post/2836616/jordi-cruyff-on-father-johan-cruyff-growing-up-and-football&quot; title=&quot;The origin of Jordi Cruyff's name&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defied the Spanish legislation forbidding couples christening their children with Catalan names when he named his first child Jordi&lt;/a&gt; (Catalan for George).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He became an icon in the country, and was all over TV and the press, oftentimes becoming also one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNtgGS_MDCU&quot; title=&quot;Johan Cruyff imitation in Crackovia TV3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;most imitated celebrities in humour TV and Radio programs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, Johan showed more respect and implication with the Catalan cause by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia_national_football_team#Johan_Cruyff.27s_era&quot; title=&quot;Catalan National Team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;managing the Catalan National Team for some years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;johan-changed-my-life&quot;&gt;3. Johan changed my life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that soon after the Wembley final, I started watching football more assiduously and turned into a big FC Barcelona fan, which I still am nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Football has since then become a fundamental part of my life: I’ve played football, I’ve watched TONS of matches, played lots of football videogames and, most of all, inherited Cruyff’s playbook in other parts of my life. As a player, I played following his style, and as a manager or team leader, I tried to apply his vision of teamwork and team crafting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right: I took some of the values and methods that he preached to apply them in real life, in business or in my personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who know me will see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/02/25-johan-cruyff-quotes.html&quot; title=&quot;Johan Cruyff's Quotes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some of Johan Cruyff’s values or best quotes&lt;/a&gt; in what I do. I mostly believe in this one: &lt;i&gt;Quality without results is pointless. Results without quality is boring.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s right. I play to win, but also to show my style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dank je wel, Johan. You changed the game forever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Include Extra Schema.org Metadata Without Messing Your Content</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/23/How-To-Include-Extra-Schema-Org-Metadata-Without-Messing-Your-Content.html" />
      <updated>2016-03-23T00:50:36+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/23/How-To-Include-Extra-Schema-Org-Metadata-Without-Messing-Your-Content</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160323post2.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160323post2.png&quot; title=&quot;Schema.org metadata HTML code&quot; alt=&quot;Schema.org metadata HTML code&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; How to include Schema.org metadata seamlessly without changing the structure of your content?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons why you might want to include &lt;a href=&quot;http://schema.org&quot; title=&quot;Schema.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Schema.org&lt;/a&gt; metadata in your website is to make it rank better. Of course, Google will favour websites including such data, as you help them understand the web better. You’re giving Google information they couldn’t understand so easily in exchange of better ranking in their search engine. Fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schema.org is quite overwhelming when you start delving into the world of SEO. It’s about tagging your website’s content so robots can understand it better, and Google will give you smart snippets in the search result pages, among other benefits. However, the possibilities are endless. You can tag People, Organisations, Blog posts, Images, Brands, Professions, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really wanted, you could tag for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges is finding the sections that really do contain all that information. But chances are the content you want to tag is spread all over the website, divided into multiple dividers and other HTML tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to tag your company’s information (as a Brand, Organisation or Company, among other options), you might tag the logo in one HTML partial, along with the name of the company. But then you realise that the company legal name, the address, and the tax ID are on the Privacy page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Schema.org requires that any entity’s information be enclosed in just one HTML tag, be it a divider, a section tag, an article tag…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to solve this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple enough: use invisible tags. In the screenshot above I show how to tag a “Person” entity. Some of the properties are visible: the profession and the image. But some of them are written nowhere in the page, but I did want to include them somehow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I created an extra file named &lt;i&gt;alex-metadata.erb&lt;/i&gt; that I included using Jekyll’s include tag, where I concentrated all metadata relative to my person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote all the metadata I wanted to aggregate using invisible tags such as &lt;i&gt;link&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;. You can see it in the screenshot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160323post.png&quot; title=&quot;Schema.org metadata HTML code&quot; alt=&quot;Schema.org metadata HTML code&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that was useful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Keep Your Remote Workers Productive</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/22/How-To-Keep-Your-Remote-Workers-Productive.html" />
      <updated>2016-03-22T21:00:46+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/22/How-To-Keep-Your-Remote-Workers-Productive</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160322post.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160322post.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Surfer on a beach&quot; alt=&quot;Surfer on a beach&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; If you can’t see them, how do you know they are really working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have hired remote freelancers, or a remote working dev shop, or you’re employing a remote-working person, chances are you will get this question every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, this is a question I get &lt;i&gt;every day&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I co-founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;, a remote-working development consultancy with my two best friends. Among a bunch of other things, being 100% remote is part of the company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, two years in and we still do not own an office. Here’s another question I get all the time: &lt;i&gt;when are you guys going to get an office?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to topic. Throughout these two first years of working 100% remotely, from very exotic places such as Mexico, San Francisco, Poland or Murcia, I think I’ve got a good answer to the aforementioned question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all boils down to these three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hire-only-proactive-people&quot;&gt;1. Hire only proactive people&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably the hardest one, and not everyone is born with hiring skills. Thus, it is really difficult to find out whether a person is proactive or not without knowing him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How will that person react to uncertainty? Will he slack off when he’s finished all the work or will he come to you asking for more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some ways to find out: leave them hanging on the phone for a while to see if they come up with questions, ask them what would they do in a certain situation, or else put them in that situation during a trial period with some test work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way we solved this at MarsBased is by only hiring people we know, or else, people someone we know can vouch for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;let-them-know-what-your-schedules-are&quot;&gt;2. Let them know what your schedules are&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main causes why remote workers stop working is because they find a stopper in their way. And most of the times, that stopper happens to be &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, you delegate the design of a certain functionality on an external designer, but you forgot to specify something crucial. Let’s say, you forgot to tell him whether the payment workflow will work for logged in users only or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mediocre designer - or, rather, someone with low proactivity - will try to contact you before working on that, because no one likes to undo his job. But if you’re working remotely, there’s a great chance that you won’t be in the same time zone, or that you will be working in different hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, maybe he needs to wait until you get back to him with an answer on the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, a more proactive person would have either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Found a way to contact you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thought through whether it makes sense for that workflow to work for logged out users.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Designed both things, since it takes only half an hour more of work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked on something else as important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Researched what’s the trend in the rest of the benchmarked companies he drew inspiration from.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever action he might take, it is surely not ‘sat on his ass’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid you being a stopper, let them know upfront what your schedules are, either at the beginning of the project or on a daily basis. This way, he will reach out to you before stoppers might happen, or else decide whether he can put it off till the next day or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;keep-their-pipeline-full&quot;&gt;3. Keep their pipeline full&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, another great way to avoid these situations is to keep them always busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Busy does not mean overstuffed with meaningless work. It means that they have other important and meaningful work that can be used as a filler for those waiting moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big projects have lots of features, sometimes conflicting with one another. But there are also loads of things that need to be re-worked on, or bugs to be fixed, content to be changed, parts of the application that need a refactor or stuff that needs to be deleted or documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your developer gets stuck in the development of feature X, you might not want him to start developing feature Y until X is finished, but you might want to allow him a fixed number of hours per week of bug-fixing so that his buffer is never empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many other things you can do to avoid this situation, but these are the three that came to mind speaking to my buddy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/sharnik&quot; title=&quot;Wojciech's Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wojciech&lt;/a&gt; today. He actually asked me that question and I thought that it might be relevant to a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your experiences? What do you do in such situations? Share your advice with us!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160321post.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160321post.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Time&quot; alt=&quot;Time&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; No matter how long you’ve been developing, there’s one thing we all struggle with: Timezones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a common thing: dealing with timezones is a nightmare in every project. Most remarkably, some of the biggest technological fuckups in history involve timezones and formats. Leap years, American vs. European date format, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if there’s something more annoying than having to deal with timezones is not really knowing that timezones are to blame when things break down. That is: something is not working, but you can’t really expect timezones to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s my recent case: yesterday I wanted to publish a blog post in this very site. When you create a blog post in Jekyll, you need to include &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll Frontmatter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the frontmatter&lt;/a&gt;, setting some metadata that will create the post according to the variables therein. For instance, this post’s frontmatter is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;---
layout: post
title: Blog Posts Not Showing on Github Pages
date: 2016-03-20T20:20:46.000Z
categories: ruby rails
icon: rails
---&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I assumed I was going to publish the post later in time, I set a future date. Unbeknownst to me, Jekyll recognises future posts and will not display them in Github Pages (where this site is hosted) until that time is reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I could see it in my local environment, but not live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I realised that, I quickly changed the time to a past date, to no avail: somehow, the metadata stays in the file, and you need to delete it and create it anew, thus forcing a new build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I faced this very issue &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt; today with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased website&lt;/a&gt;, just that this time, the website is built using Middleman. Same dog, different collar. Everything I said about Jekyll previously applies to Middleman now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to publish a post tomorrow, so I saved the file with tomorrow’s date. When I realised I could publish today instead, I reverted, but it was too late. I then proceeded to check the time, and corrected the time variable in the frontmatter to match the current value. When I deployed to Github Pages, however, it would not show, even though the time was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like Middleman comes with UTC as a default timezone. Therefore, even if I had the right time written, for Middleman it was London time, hence not displaying the post as it understood it was programmed for the next hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting the &lt;code&gt;Time.zone = &quot;Berlin&quot;&lt;/code&gt; in Middleman’s &lt;strong&gt;config.rb&lt;/strong&gt; file solved the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Jekyll, to do the same, you do it in the &lt;strong&gt;_config.yml&lt;/strong&gt; file with the following key/value combination:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;timezone: 'Europe/Andorra'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, lessons learnt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never create posts with future times, not even for testing. Create them with past dates instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set the timezone first thing when you set up your Jekyll/Middleman projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way: there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35477485/jekyll-blog-not-updating-showing-new-posts&quot; title=&quot;Why do my new blog posts not show on github pages&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a million other reasons why your post might not show up on Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;: incorrect characters in the title (double colon, most likely), your post does not follow the naming conventions, or many others, but I won’t cover them in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Tragic Day for the Erasmus Family</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/20/a-tragic-day-for-the-erasmus-family.html" />

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/20/a-tragic-day-for-the-erasmus-family</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160320post.jpg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160320post.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Condolences to the ESN UB Family&quot; alt=&quot;Condolences to the ESN UB Family&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Today I woke to the terrible news of a tragedy that affected one of my closest families. I want to send out my deepest condolences to the affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am deeply afflicted by this traffic accident that hit right where it hurts the most: the young and the innocent. A trip that should be remembered because of its cultural importance and joyful nature will now enter the black pages of our country’s history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I belonged to &lt;a href=&quot;http://esn.org&quot; title=&quot;Erasmus Student Network&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ESN&lt;/a&gt; (short for Erasmus Student Network) for almost five intense years of my life. Almost two years in Munich at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.international.tum.de/willkommen-an-der-tum/internationale-austauschstudierende/tuminternational/&quot; title=&quot;TUMi München&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TUMi&lt;/a&gt; and then three as a founding member of &lt;a href=&quot;http://esnupf.org/&quot; title=&quot;ESN UPF&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ESN UPF&lt;/a&gt;. I remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/alex.rodba/posts/357252211030173&quot; title=&quot;The day when I left ESN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the day I decided to quit ESN&lt;/a&gt; as a turning point in my life. It all started in Munich, it ended in Munich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At ESN, we made sure all exchange students in our universities could enjoy the best time of their lives during their exchanges. We, more often than not, organised trips, parties and cultural events. I myself helped to organise many trips during my ESN years, although I never took part in the Las Fallas one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tragedy followed celebration. Sadly, a whole batch of Erasmus will be scarred for life after this. We all should strive to help them and their families recover from this. ESN, and Erasmus, is not only about partying. It’s about everyone bonding together across borders and nations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all a big family: students, coordinators, alumni, partners and collaborators alike. We stand together through thick and thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help to ease the pain and clarify the causes of the accident, it’s vital that during such events only the official truth be spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://esn.org/news/statement-traffic-accident-near-freginals-spain&quot; title=&quot;ESN official statement about the Freginals tragedy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;official ESN statement regarding this tragedy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, retweet &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StartupGrindBCN/status/711631802071441409&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind BCN sends condolences to ESN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to help spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where Did All the Google Glass Go?</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/15/where-did-all-the-google-glass-go.html" />
      <updated>2016-03-15T22:13:46+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/15/where-did-all-the-google-glass-go</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160318post.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160318post.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Disqus code snippet&quot; alt=&quot;Disqus code snippet&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; This is the third year I spend at least a month in San Francisco. I went two years ago for a life-changing experience I wrote about here and here (I never published the third part, and I’m wondering whether it makes sense at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People come and go. Changes are all around in such a hectic and change-driven city. New startups blossom while others perish. Trends are different every year, and fashion is something unpredictable if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that has really amazed me is the downfall of Google Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, one in every ten people would be wearing a Google Glass in San Francisco. At conferences, in the office, in coffee shops and even buying groceries. In fact, I reckon some of my American friends owned one back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year it was not so common to see them, but they were still around. It was much less frequent to see the iconic Google glasses, but they were still there. Mostly at the office and at conferences, if I recall correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year they were nowhere to be seen. Not one in five weeks. Extinguished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, everyone is wearing an iWatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all truth, I never cared much about the glasses. I was happy when cell phones came around back in the 90s because that allowed me to get rid of my wristwatch. Now, with the iWatch and the smartwatches trend in full effervescence, I can only wish it never settles. I do not cherish to wear a watch again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this reasoning for Google Glass. I don’t wear glasses. Glasses are something used by people who need to correct their eyes’ imprecisions. Why should I decide to use them on purpose? The whole concept was mind-blogging to me and totally unappealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only wonder, where did all these glasses go? When Google projects are discontinued they go to a kind of Google Heaven, to meet Orkut, Google Reader, Google Wave and other failed products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is a hardware project. In whose drawer did all these glasses end?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you own the infamous Google Glass glasses? What did you do with them? Tell me how was your experience :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now Playing:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/520ya4z36Buibr3c5mbI02&quot; title=&quot;Manel - Vés, bruixot!&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-spotify&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Manel - Vés, bruixot!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Good Reason to Buy and Retain Your Domain Name</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/13/a-good-reason-to-buy-and-retain-your-domain-name.html" />

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/13/a-good-reason-to-buy-and-retain-your-domain-name</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160313post2.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160313post2.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;A Computer&quot; alt=&quot;A Computer&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; No clickbait here: a 22400% price increase in a year is a good reason to buy a domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I published this very website, so I set out to give it a cool domain name. The site is built on Github pages, which allow you to host your website plus your own domain for free. All you need to do is buy the domain name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember back in the day I bought the domain name www.alexrb.com (and other endings like .net, .co and the like). However, one year ago, the domain was not automatically renewed because of a failed payment from my side. I never solved the problem, so I lost it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the email receipt I got from GoDaddy in 2013, when I bought them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160313postgodaddy.png&quot; title=&quot;Godaddy Email Receipt&quot; alt=&quot;Godaddy Email Receipt&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;For 30 bucks, I bought a bunch of cool domain names.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the price for just the dotcom domain today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160313postgodaddy2.png&quot; title=&quot;Godaddy's outrageous pricing&quot; alt=&quot;Godaddy's outrageous pricing&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Are. You. Freaking. Kidding. Me.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1800 bucks for a personal domain? A 22400% increase on the price in just a year? These people clearly know more than I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson learnt:&lt;/strong&gt; the domain sector is like the stock exchange. Buy your domains early and retain them over time, and you’ll be a respected fundamentalist. Speculate over someone else’s domains’ huge price increases and drops and you’ll be an infamous trader that can make lots of money in just one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

      <title>Disqus Not Loading on Strata Jekyll Template</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/13/disqus-not-loading-on-strata-jekyll-template.html" />
      <updated>2016-03-13T12:14:46+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/13/disqus-not-loading-on-strata-jekyll-template</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160313post.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160313post.png&quot; title=&quot;Disqus code snippet&quot; alt=&quot;Disqus code snippet&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; After two years of putting off the decision of creating a personal website, yesterday I put an end to this agony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/strata/&quot; title=&quot;Strata Jekyll Template&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Strata Jekyll template&lt;/a&gt; and Github pages I’ve been able to set this up, with a few tweaks here and there, in a mere two hours. Most of the time I spent working on the content and tweaking the look and feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have had some issues while implementing Disqus to enhance the blog. Strata did not include Disqus out of the box. Even if I’ve implemented it several times in the past, there was some rust to shake off, as I’m nowadays doing only business development for &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; coded for a couple of years or more. This time, I’ve had a couple of issues before I got it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I did not get the code snipped right. I copied it from a previous website and looks like Disqus was taking none of it. It’s changed in the last versions, so make sure you’re getting the last version of the code snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was following &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472138-jekyll-installation-instructions&quot; title=&quot;Disques Official Documentation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Disqus’ official documentation&lt;/a&gt; to install the popular comments system. However, when I got &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.disqus.com/admin/universalcode/&quot; title=&quot;Disqus code snippet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the code snippet&lt;/a&gt; I couldn’t get it loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;       &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;row&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noscript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Please&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;nofollow&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;powered&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;noscript&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you sign up for Disqus, you select a username, and that is usually enough (or it used to be like this). Now you need to login to your account to confirm the username (weird, why asking it in the signup?) and then add the trusted domains - as always. To confirm the trusted domains, go to the ‘Advanced’ settings tab and include the domain of your site. So if your domain is ‘www.marsbased.com’, you need to write ‘marsbased.com’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That enabled the load of Disqus itself, but once I loaded the page, I could not see it. A quick inspect at the generated HTML told me the content was there. Turns out, for some reason the div with id=”disqus_thread” had no width. I solved it by adding this to the CSS file of my site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;#disqus_thread{
    width: 100%;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that were not enough, turns out that when I deployed live, Disqus would load on some pages, while on some others it would not. That’s because I hadn’t set the &lt;strong&gt;this.page.url&lt;/strong&gt; parameter using an absolute URL. If you don’t set it to an absolute URL, Disqus will load in some pages while in some others it might not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, you in the Jekyll documentation they recommend that you wrap up the Disqus code between &lt;strong&gt;  {% if post.comments %}  &lt;/strong&gt; block so that you can turn on and off at post level. That seemed to work fine when deploying locally but did not work then pushing it to Github pages. Because I did not want to waste time on it, I completely removed that condition. I also want Disqus to show up in all blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case none of the above worked, you might want to check this &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22&quot; title=&quot;Disqus help center&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thread on the Disqus help center for the infamous ‘We were unable to load Disqus’ message&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (2016-04-16):&lt;/strong&gt; I found lately that Disqus was loading randomly again. After a couple hours tweaking here and there, I found that I hadn’t changed the URL of the page in the Disqus Admin panel. It still reflected the original Github Pages URL, not the one with the current domain www.alexrodba.com. Setting it to reflect the current domain fixed the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that was useful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/12/hello-mars.html" />
      <updated>2016-03-12T15:37:44+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/03/12/hello-mars</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160312post.jpg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160312post.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Surface of Mars&quot; title=&quot;Surface of Mars&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Welcome to my new personal web page!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so excited to launch this living and breathing website which will aggregate all my work. It will contain what I do at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/a&gt;, plus other cool stuff I like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this website is to pour my heart out and show who I really am. I usually blog for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marsbased.com/blog&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/u/m634ms/&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/a&gt;, where I write about entrepreneurship, business, marketing, blogging, company culture, sales and web development. I also own a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.medium.com/alexrodba&quot; title=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit on Medium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medium account&lt;/a&gt; where I syndicate some of my best content and publish brutally honest posts that might not fit neither Startup Grind nor MarsBased, as they contain very personal views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this site, I will be able to publish some stuff that’s relevant to my persona: what I like, stuff I recommend, my talks and I will try to write very often about non-business stuff. Music? Gaming? Books? Tacos? Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Learnt from Going Phoneless for Two Months</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/02/29/What-i-learnt-from-going-phoneless-for-two-months.html" />
      <updated>2016-02-29T20:11:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/02/29/What-i-learnt-from-going-phoneless-for-two-months</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160229.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160229.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Snorkeling in Greece&quot; alt=&quot;Snorkeling in Greece&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; This is me, deeply worried about having lost my phone and trying to find a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we live in rush hour. Everything is urgent. All tasks are for ASAP, deadlines are crucial, and the project should have been completed yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that we carry our personal computer (aka ‘smartphone’) in our pockets makes it even easier to reach out at whatever time, regardless of whether you are working or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have come to this absurd point: if you are reachable, you are working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background: my Nexus 5’s charging pin broke on my second day of holidays in Greece. I was on a small island (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Greece/@36.8546751,25.6753664,10.95z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x135b4ac711716c63:0x363a1775dc9a2d1d&quot; title=&quot;Amorgos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amorgos&lt;/a&gt;) and a strict travel plan I needed to adhere to. This plan did not include visiting any place where I could get it fixed. After my holidays, I engaged in a back-and-forth struggle with customer assistance, who was refusing to fix the phone even if it had a valid warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, for two months I went phoneless, and I learnt a thing or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nothing-is-really-urgent&quot;&gt;1. Nothing is really urgent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe not nothing, but rarely ever something will be a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of the last three times you had an emergency. What did you do instinctively? Call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are in a hurry and call for help, Murphy’s law makes it dead sure everyone’s cell phone is off, wifi is not working and you’re stranded. Then you start figuring out how to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you’re in an emergency, try to work out the problem first and if you can’t solve it, ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people will understand that you were busy, or your phone was broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-one-depends-only-on-you&quot;&gt;2. No one depends only on you&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily enough, no one on this planet depends only and exclusively on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the case for many of you, if not most. That is, if someone wants to reach out and they can’t find you, they will be forced to find an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re worried about not being reachable, we’re indulging in some serious FOMO (fear of missing out). If my phone is not working, I will miss out on everybody’s updates. Or else, I won’t be reachable if my grandmother needs assistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOMO causes only stress. Get rid of it, and you’ll live happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely ever they will need to contact &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160229bis.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Koufonissia&quot; alt=&quot;Koufonissia&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;If there was a reason to get my phone fixed, was to capture these landscapes. Next time, I’m bringing a camera.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-businesses-can-be-phoneless&quot;&gt;3. Some businesses can be phoneless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re on holiday, as a founder of a business, you need to keep an eye on your venture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;, we work mostly with medium- and big-sized companies that need to outsource their development. Our project average length is 3–4 months of work, so we don’t get a client every day. And actually, most of our clients are found using inbound marketing, so it’s difficult to predict when they will want to chat with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my phoneless months, I did not receive a single email telling me “I was trying to call you and you never seem to be reachable”. At most, I received some whatsapps from my family asking if I was OK, but nothing related to clients or business stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come to think of it, as a business that relies almost 100% on inbound marketing, what good is a phone number? Phone calls are still not easy to track or introduce in the CRM, just like an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I inspected our CRM and found that only two opportunities came directly through the phone in two years, and they ended up not qualifying as potential customers for MarsBased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are we facing the end of the telephone era for business? What happened the last time you went phoneless for a while?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>After a Year of Throwing Away Stuff, I’m Going Minimalist</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/01/28/After-a-year-of-throwing-away-stuff-i-am-going-minimalist.html" />
      <updated>2016-01-28T20:11:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2016/01/28/After-a-year-of-throwing-away-stuff-i-am-going-minimalist</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20160128.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160128.png&quot; title=&quot;Minimalism&quot; alt=&quot;Minimalism&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Every time you move into a new house, you realise how much stuff you own. It is equally true, that the amount of things you own tends to increase with time, so every time you change house is a bigger nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last ten years, I changed house four times, and I feel that I should be changing again rather sooner than later. The thing is, up until now, I only owned enough stuff to fit a room or two, but for the last six years, I’ve owned a house, with all its appliances and furniture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really do &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; look forward to moving out with all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimalism&quot;&gt;Minimalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Minimalism has been a trend in quite a lot of disciplines: from art to education, but also in pedagogy and music. In fact, the picture above is what you get if you type “definition of minimalism” in Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the kind of minimalism I am embracing is the material minimalism. You’ll find a really good post about it by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buffer.com/&quot; title=&quot;Buffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;’s Leo Widrich &lt;a href=&quot;http://leostartsup.com/2014/12/living-with-one-bag/&quot; title=&quot;Living with one bag&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In short, trimming down your list of belongings to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I wanted to include it as a new year resolution but had too much stuff on my plate to actually focus on this. I did, however, get rid of 300 items, so almost an item a day (there was a heavy spring cleaning that maxed that number). So without meaning it, I accomplished it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year I did include it in my new year resolutions, which I will publish later on. My commitment is to get rid of an item every day of the year. In order to track this, I created a public spreadsheet that I will be updating daily. You can find it &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F6zkoVmu_sp-u_1RZxTAyDyCcrUKDmiYt91muKs_VIQ/edit?usp=sharing&quot; title=&quot;My minimalist list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-do-it&quot;&gt;How to do it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy: once a day you find an item you can either sell, give to a friend or throw away. Some tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you haven’t used that item for a year, you don’t need it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re keeping something because of its emotional value, take a picture of it and throw it away (digitise it).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That fine red wine bottle for special occasions, give it to a friend. That’s special enough.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re keeping something you can make money out of, use second-hand items trading apps (I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wallapop.com&quot; title=&quot;Wallapop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wallapop&lt;/a&gt; here) and sell them there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you feel like buying a new pair of shoes, for instance, try getting rid of three pairs of them before you do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digitise all documents and paper stuff to Evernote or Dropbox so you have it available at all times, searchable, taggable, and completely backed up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Commit to donating toys/clothes/food/etc to local NGOs, at least a month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-reasons-to-do-it&quot;&gt;My reasons to do it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, because I realised clutter takes space. Not only that, but it brings a lot of distractions. Consider that at the time of writing this blog entry, my desktop looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160128mess.png&quot; title=&quot;Cluttered desktop&quot; alt=&quot;Cluttered desktop&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Quite a mess, like a good artist.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, with a much cleaner desktop, I can focus on my laptop, instead of on any of the surrounding distraction-inducing elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20160128clean.png&quot; title=&quot;Clean desktop&quot; alt=&quot;Clean desktop&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Much better!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as mentioned above, I don’t want to face another move with this amount of belongings. I am going to save a lot of money and time if I slowly declutter one thing a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping too much stuff at home might trigger the development of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_syndrome&quot; title=&quot;Diogenes Syndrome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Diogenes Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, so I wanted to play it safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another big reason is because I plan to travel around the world for a good while. Last year I committed to planning my trip around the world for 2017, so I’ve got only one year to make it true. I will have to store my stuff somewhere, so the less I have, the easier it’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you had any experience with going minimalist? Do you plan to do it but can’t find the time? Share your story below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, I do not find any satisfaction in owning a lot of stuff. We tend to accumulate stuff partly because we do not know how to deal with it when we get them. Therefore, we store it in a cupboard or put it high on a shelf and delegate dealing with it with our future selves.
If I could travel back in time I’d kick my past self in the head for forcing me to deal with this now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Simple Trick to Find out Who Sends You Spam</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/12/23/A-simple-trick-to-find-out-who-sends-you-spam.html" />
      <updated>2015-12-23T20:11:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/12/23/A-simple-trick-to-find-out-who-sends-you-spam</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20151223.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151223.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Apple Mac and iPhone&quot; alt=&quot;Apple Mac and iPhone&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; I get a lot of spam. A LOT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read this, you probably have the same problem, so I’ll help you track where does your spam come from using Gmail aliases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background first: I am a curious person and I like to sign up for heaps of stuff to be up-to-date with the coolest trends or things to come. That’s like every other person, but luckily enough, Gmail blocks almost everything for us. I wouldn’t imagine a world without Gmail. God forbid the Hotmail era and the ones before that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things got even worse when I switched my LinkedIn title to “Co-Founder at &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;” and when, barely a few months after that, I was appointed as Chapter Director for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.cat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like everyone wants to sell me stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For almost two years, I have been signed up to hundreds of new email lists, most of them without my permission. Unbeknownst to them, though, I can easily track them with a simple trick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shut-up-and-take-my-privacy&quot;&gt;Shut up and take my privacy!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I briefly mentioned Gmail’s awesomeness when blocking spam. They do a great job in exchange, among other things, for our privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, for one, don’t give much of a fig about online privacy because of two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The more stuff you’ve got to hide, the more people will be trying to gain access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When a product is free, you’re the product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave up the long-lost battle for internet privacy in the early Gmail days and, as a result, I live a much more relaxed (albeit a tad naïve) online life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to topic, Gmail does not only filter spam using their secret sauce, they also gave us something called &lt;i&gt;aliases&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-an-alias&quot;&gt;What’s an alias?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your email is &lt;b&gt;johnsmith@gmail.com&lt;/b&gt;, then &lt;b&gt;john.smith@gmail.com&lt;/b&gt; is an alias. Not only can you place dots all along the email username, but you can append “+&lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt;” to create new email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, email aliases of &lt;b&gt;johnsmith@gmail.com&lt;/b&gt; are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;john.smith@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;j.o.h.n.s.m.i.t.h@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;j.ohnsmith@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;johnsmith+lovesurmom@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;johnsmith+tracksspam@gmail.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;… and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Possibilities are endless. If you want more detail, you might want to read this article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldguide.gizmodo.com/how-to-use-the-infinite-number-of-email-addresses-gmail-1609458192&quot; title=&quot;Other uses for Gmail aliases&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other uses for Gmail aliases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-track-spam-using-gmail-aliases&quot;&gt;How to track spam using Gmail aliases?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s simple. Every time you sign up for some newsletter or contest, type in a new Gmail alias (&lt;i&gt;johnsmith+spam123@gmail.com, johnsmith+spam245@gmail.com,&lt;/i&gt; etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: I signed up to test an online service for MarsBased. I ended up not using the service and deleted my account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some weeks afterwards, I received a call while I was heading to a meeting, asking for me. The woman calling asked whether I had read the email she had sent me. Assuming it was a potential client, I told her I’d get back to her after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, it was not a client. I had just been spammed. Again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my inbox, I had an email selling jewellery to me. I have never been interested in jewels, so I set out to find how did they get my email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was easy to track where did the email come from, as I remember when I created this alias and what for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151223spam.png&quot; title=&quot;Spam&quot; alt=&quot;Spam&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Now I can send them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;es_th=1&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=spam%20revenge&amp;amp;es_th=1&quot; title=&quot;SPAM Revenge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;some love&lt;/a&gt; myself.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not originally planned for this, you can use this to your advantage. Use it wisely!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All My Life I’ve Been Listening, Now It’s Time to Speak</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/12/09/All-my-life-ive-been-listening-now-its-time-to-speak.html" />
      <updated>2015-12-09T20:11:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/12/09/All-my-life-ive-been-listening-now-its-time-to-speak</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20151209.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151209.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Typewriter&quot; alt=&quot;Typewriter&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; When people turn 50, 30, any other meaningful number, or recover from a long illness, sober up or reach some sort of milestone in their lives, they usually write about what have they learnt throughout the process and/or what are they grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not very keen on these lists, but lately I’ve read a couple of articles that have had an impact on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short&quot; title=&quot;Days are long, decades are short&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Days Are Long, Decades Are Short&lt;/a&gt;, by Sam Altman (YCombinator). I have a tremendous respect for Sam, even though I have never met him in real life, other than watching him talk a couple of times in Silicon Valley. However, out of all the blogs out there, his is significantly honest and nonchalant, unlike most entrepreneurs’ blogs. It’s incredible how down-to-earth he is despite his status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one is &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@albertqian/i-ve-been-alive-for-10-000-days-ca55fa5d114c#.gd50qa2e3&quot; title=&quot;I've been alive for 10000 days&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I’ve Been Alive for 10000 Days&lt;/a&gt;, by Albert Qian. Unlike Sam, I do know Albert. We met two years ago at &lt;a href=&quot;http://hinge.co/&quot; title=&quot;Hinge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt;’s launch party in San Francisco and have kept contact ever since. Albert has built his way up to create &lt;a href=&quot;http://albertslist.org/&quot; title=&quot;Albert's list&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Albert’s List&lt;/a&gt; from scratch, a private Facebook group for job seekers that garners now over 11k people. Albert is making connections happen all around the Bay Area and helping people non-stop. He’s, above all, a really great guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend you to read these articles, so save them for later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-learnings&quot;&gt;My learnings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m just pouring my heart out here. As I said previously, I am not a fan of such lists, because I do not identify myself very often with the optimistic all-is-bight-and-shiny approach they take 99% of the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Albert put it: if you spend 10k hours doing something, you master it. Therefore, having lived over 10k hours means you have mastered yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I found myself when I turned 27. Somewhere along the creation of MarsBased and the realisation of &lt;i&gt;WHAT THE FUCK HAD I BEEN DOING UNTIL THEN?&lt;/i&gt; After two years, I think not much has changed, and I feel pretty confident when I say I have shaped who I am and who I want to be in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I compiled a list for people like me, who do not fit into these generic lists, and that might appreciate that I tell those truths that are hard to swallow. I hope I won’t be too blunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unless scientifically proven, you only live once. Make the most out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read a lot. Your brain is a sponge and there’s no limit to all you can learn, so do it. Being an ignorant is a choice nowadays, given the access to all sorts of information that libraries and Internet grant us.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, everybody needs something that numbs your brain every once in a while. Do it sparingly and with moderation. For me, watching football works a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t consume force-fed content. Choose on-demand instead. You pay for it, you’ve got the power over it. Don’t think you don’t pay for it because it’s free. You’re just not paying with money. If the product is free, you are the product.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Defy absolutely everything. Do not accept anything as true just because you read it on the Internet or because a famous person said it. Everybody makes mistakes. Again: being an ignorant is a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make different stuff everyday. Challenge yourself. Push your limits higher. Are you left-handed? Train your right hand. Are you afraid of heights? Go rock-climbing. New experiences strengthen your brain connections and make time pass more slowly, so you’ll enjoy life longer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Travel. Do it for business, for love, to get away from your city’s noise &amp;amp; pollution, for a one-night stand, to set foot on each continent, to take selfies with the world’s greatest natural wonders, for a concert, to attend a friend’s wedding, or just to learn new languages and cultures. Traveling is investing in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen to people. Then defy them and follow your gut. Don’t follow blindly but also don’t ignore advice. You make the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Discuss and argue sparingly. Tell someone to fuck right off every now and then to let it all out, but make sure you will never meet that person again. Never burn bridges with people close to you (family, friends, workmates, bosses). It might be wrong to be rude, but it feels so good.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t do yoga, mindfulness, tai-chi, or follow other people’s life advice that does not resonate with you. All these “psychology of happiness”, “find your inner peace” and “be positive” programs/posts/events/coaches are just not for me. Accept it, we are not all cut from the same cloth, so they might not apply to you either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Being nice costs nothing, but being insincere can be costly. Be upfront without being rude. Be thankful for good services, complain about bad services. Normal services? Smile and pass. Don’t choose them again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t look compulsively for a mentor or a guidance in life. I learn more when I teach people than when I listen from them. Chances are, there are more people like me out there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t do things because they are right. Do them for a purpose. Don’t exercise because it’s good. Set goals: do it to lose 10kg and run half-marathons. Do not quit smoking because it’s bad. Do it because you want to be fit when your grandchildren are born.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Life’s not all about planning: take breaks when your body requires it. Your boss will understand, and so will your girlfriend. If not, they are not the right people for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Treasure your memories. When all hell breaks loose or when you lose everything, memories will not go away.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Likewise, and as stupid as it sounds, store everything in the cloud. Then replicate it. It’s not funny to lose all your digital stuff. It’s part of your memories, and hence of your brain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Screw moderation: there are many good things in life that can be enjoyed without moderation: drinking water, stargazing, listening to music and chatting to friends — just to name a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are in pain and you can’t find a suitable time to go to the doctor, ditch that job. If you can’t afford to go to the doctor, ditch that job (or if the health system is private in your country, you might want to move elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You might have read about this somewhere else, but you are the average of the five people you spend most time with. Go find these people.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s perfectly OK to be 30 and not have a clue of what to do in life. So is being 40 and not having children. It’s also OK to have dropped out of school for a good reason. People who know better than you what’s good for you are probably unsatisfied with their lives as well. Moreover, when the epiphany comes, you will know it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use your skills to your advantage. Don’t be too humble: it might hinder your career.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be assertive. Always strive to grow through self-affirmation, never negating the others.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’re not part of the solution, you are part of the problem. Think this through every time you complain about something.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If somebody comes to offer advice or mentoring because he/she’s a mentor, he/she’s probably not. If you’re something, you do not go around saying it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Years ago, being on the Internet was a real advantage over the competition. Nowadays, going offline makes a difference. Everybody’s online and you can’t tell one from the other. Eye-to-eye meetings win deals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Help people for the sake of helping. This is like investing: you’ll waste your time and money in most cases, but the one that pays off, comes back tenfold.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Ask stuff right away. Do not waste other people’s time. Also, don’t be late: it’s one of the rudest things you can do and it just shows how many fucks you give about other people’s feelings. Exactly: none.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Be yourself. Life’s too short to be someone else. So ignore all advice from this post and create your own list if that serves you. Tell me to fuck off in the comments section if it helps you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember #1 and live by it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>A Letter to our Startup Grind BCN Community: Never Stop Grinding</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/12/02/A-Letter-to-our-Startup-Grind-BCN-Community-Never-Stop-Grinding.html" />
      <updated>2015-12-02T20:11:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/12/02/A-Letter-to-our-Startup-Grind-BCN-Community-Never-Stop-Grinding</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20151202.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151202.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Despair&quot; alt=&quot;Despair&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Dear Startup Grind Barcelona community,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had our most misfortunate event ever at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Everything that could go wrong went wrong&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure Murphy’s laughing his arse off from wherever he might be right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been successfully running Startup Grind in Barcelona for over a year and a half now by doing at least an event every month. Like every other initiative, we’ve had our highs and lows, but this one has taken a toll on the team’s morale, and I think it’s good to wind down on a public platform so everyone can learn from our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more: I have got the feeling that we will come back to this post more often than not, when something goes wrong again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;we-had-a-bad-start-one-month-ago&quot;&gt;We had a bad start one month ago&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things started to go wrong when one month before the event I received a call from our regular venue saying there had been a misunderstanding. They reserved the dates for our events until March, but they failed to save our date for November, so we had to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily enough, we have got plenty of options to choose from because we have been holding talks with many coworking spaces and other cool venues throughout the months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since time was running out, we decided to go for a safe shot. We chose the comfort of Barcelona Activa, where we had been before (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNpq77Bzt84&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind BCN hosted Pablo Villalba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remember our event of June with Pablo Villalba&lt;/a&gt;) and where we feel always like home, thanks to the massive job of two wonderful individuals: Itziar Blasco and Xavier Dumont. They have been big supporters of our cause since the very beginning. Hats off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things looked slightly brighter when we were able to communicate this accordingly and we saw that the ticket sales were not affected by the change, although we know that moving out of our regular venue means selling 20% fewer tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a normal event we almost compensate all our expenses (material, catering, cabs &amp;amp; unplanned expenses) with the ticket sales, so we can say we’re &lt;i&gt;close&lt;/i&gt; to break-even. That’s ok: after all, Startup Grind is an investment that pays off in many other ways, so I am not looking to win any money. However, it would be great not to lose any money either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: moving out of our regular venue means losing more money. Actually, if there’s one big caveat of doing the event at Barcelona Activa is that they cover all the costs except the Audio Technician, which is usually around 300–350 euro for a couple hours. That means we’ve lost some big money with this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dealing-with-providers&quot;&gt;Dealing with providers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to respect the honour of our providers I will not mention them personally, but so we can all learn from this, I’ll share the story here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might be aware, some of our providers are paid with the money we get from the ticketing, and some are unpaid, depending on what kind of sponsorship we’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my four years volunteering at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esn.org/&quot; title=&quot;ESN&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ESN&lt;/a&gt;, I learnt what volunteer / &lt;i&gt;pro bono&lt;/i&gt; work is and I know it’s not ideal. However, as I wrote a couple of posts ago, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lexrodba/my-reasons-to-become-an-entrepreneur-e3bb75dfc921#.5knp8p4d4&quot; title=&quot;My reasons to become an entrepreneur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;if you’re not ready to invest in yourself, you won’t make it as an entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;. Making strong alliances that compensate your work with other things than money is a good way to get started. It can even to bring you to the next level. You should carefully select with whom you can and are willing to work for free, and with whom you shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay away from toxic clients that only want to drag you down by working for them for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, stay close to high-level acquaintances that can bring your project to a higher level by partnering with them. Sometimes it’s the wisest move you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, we’ve got a great relationship with our providers but this month we had to endure the following mistakes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some material was delivered in a different address than specified, so we had to move it ourselves.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The fridge arrived only three hours before the event. As a result, beverages were not cold.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One provider raised the prices without prior notice.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Another provider gave a last minute notice that they were showing up, after a month of unresponsiveness. Still better than not showing up, but I had given up all hope.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We were supposed to get a new photographer but turned down the offer last minute.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The venue rejected our idea of offering welcome drinks as we usually do. They would only be allowed in the networking session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to choose what chore is the most tiresome when organising events, it’s dealing with providers. Thankfully, our co-director &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/ccruzrastrojo&quot; title=&quot;Carlos Cruz on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Carlos&lt;/a&gt; is helping me do that more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shortage-of-volunteers&quot;&gt;Shortage of volunteers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life’s enough complicated as it is, but some of us really like adventure and we love volunteering. Call us masochists. We just don’t like easy stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides my Chapter co-directors &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/ccruzrastrojo&quot; title=&quot;Carlos Cruz on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Carlos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/alexglezgarcia&quot; title=&quot;Alex Gonzalez on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alex&lt;/a&gt;, we’re lucky to count on a tireless army of 5 volunteers. But Startup Grind is not a job for any of us, so everybody has got their own steady gig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend most of my day growing &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;, while Alex provides kickass sales-hacking services to companies and startups alike, Carlos starts up his new venture &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iyiyim.es/&quot; title=&quot;Iyiyim&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iyiyim&lt;/a&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that everyone has got his own job leaves small to no time to devote to Startup Grind. Despite my insistence, I can’t battle reality, and I know we all have to look for our own good first (i.e: money) and leave volunteering for whatever little spare time our steady jobs allow us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally we’re about five people in the venue doing all sorts of tasks, and it’s quite enough. This time we were two: Carlos and I, until 15 minutes in the event. Luckily enough, Marc and Pol came to the rescue shortly thereafter and eased things out. Thank you, buddies, I owe you a beer, even if you came later than expected because your car broke down (that damn Murphy!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-event&quot;&gt;The event&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these aforementioned problems took a toll on Carlos and me, and consequently our confidence and self-esteem was probably at an all-time low when we started the event. I was, in fact, so distracted by it, that I hadn’t sent the last-minute instructions to our speaker &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/leesimon&quot; title=&quot;Simon Lee on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Simon Lee&lt;/a&gt;. He, however, had been very active on Twitter retweeting all our stuff, so he was informed, and he showed up right on time despite having felt sick the whole day. Hats off to him, he brightened up our day! Gràcies, Simon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, we did not have Alex rocking the first part of the event because he’s on his honeymoon, but Carlos fills his shoes perfectly, as he’s done a couple of times in the past. Therefore, the open mic went quite well, I must say. Carlos did a great job to start picking up from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when the keynote arrived, the cable to connect the computer to the projector gave up working. So our CTO at MarsBased, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/xavier_redo&quot; title=&quot;Xavier Redó on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Xavi&lt;/a&gt;, had to confront this situation by starting his really inspirational keynote without the slides. Xavi has got stage presence, so he handled the situation accordingly. That’s what being the frontman of a rock band during high school years teach you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiftly, Xavier Dumont from BCN Activa came to our rescue with a new cable and resolved the issue, but that made us lose a good ten minutes that shortened our fireside chat a little later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that our roll-up broke didn’t even matter to me at that point. We had to fix it quickly right before the fireside chat. The whole city could’ve burnt to a crisp and I wouldn’t have given a fuck about it. Honestly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was the last problem we had, as the rest of the event worked very well, thanks to Simon and his high spirits (despite being ill) and our loyal attendees who sparked a good networking session. I’d like to give special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kailaniicetea.com/&quot; title=&quot;Kailani Ice Tea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kailani ice tea&lt;/a&gt; for offering his new products to us during this session. You’ve got a new customer, Guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;moral-of-the-story-never-give-up&quot;&gt;Moral of the story: never give up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “do not give up” thing you will hear it daily when you’re starting up a business, or attending entrepreneurs’ events. It’s a no-brainer. Winners never quit, quitters never win and all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s really in moments like these, when all seems to go to hell, when you feel like giving up and cancelling the event, closing your business or just take the first plane to a remote island and disappear for seven years. In moments like these, you should not fail yourself. You should find that &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; that keeps you grinding. That inspirational spark that picks you up and makes you walk an extra mile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that keeps me going at Startup Grind is walking on stage and seeing the familiar faces of our community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having 50% of recurring attendees every event, month after month, after over 20 events in over a year and a half, might mean something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having people coming to every event consistently since we started. Having people that missed out on an event, but they are the first ones to send me a Whatsapp or a tweet “how did it go tonight?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These things might mean something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might mean we’re doing something right, or that they like the catering we offer. Maybe they just come to pitch one another during the networking session or to steal beer (we saw this actually happening in this last event). Might as well be that they’re into one of us (most likely into Marc), or that they just feel good among so many motivated &amp;amp; cheerful entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, it means more than that. But I’ll keep that to myself because that’s what keeps me going.
Just one final push to wrap up 2015 with a final blast: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/startup-grind-barcelona-hosts-manel-sort-king-tickets-19256433511&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosts Manel Sort&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Manel Sort (Head of Studio in Spain)&lt;/a&gt;. It’s going to be HUGE. If you miss out, you’ll never forgive yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, onto 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never stop grinding. We’ll never do.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I Never Answer Straight Away</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/11/17/Why-I-Never-Answer-Straight-Away.html" />
      <updated>2015-11-17T20:11:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/11/17/Why-I-Never-Answer-Straight-Away</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20151117.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151117.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Coffee table&quot; alt=&quot;Coffee table&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; If you’re reading this, chances are you might probably be waiting for an answer from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be an email, an overdue payment, a whatsapp (yes, I read your whatsapp right when you sent it) or your message on Facebook/Twitter/Hangouts/Skype/Swarm/Runkeeper/Last.fm/Tinder/LinkedIn/Instagram/Microsoft Excel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, you probably did not send me a message through Microsoft Excel, but you know you’d try in those days I seem to ignore all your messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if I told you there are many reasons to do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, we’ve adopted immediacy as something normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember when we had to wait until 6PM to connect our flatrate internet connection and check our email? Remember when we paid for SMS (well, in Spain we still do, as ridiculous as it sounds) so you had to carefully choose your words? Communication was way slower then. It was, too, way more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we are assuming that the other person will be slacking off on the couch, waiting for people to contact them and chat for a while. We also can safely assume that if the other person lives in a big city, she’ll have 4G or at least three or four available wi-fi connections nearby to rely on, so she will get the message and reply right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when that doesn’t happen — that is, when the person we’re trying to talk to does not reply within a minute — , we start thinking something might be wrong: “he might be in a meeting”, “maybe he’s got no battery”, or even worse “might be he’s upset with me”, “he’s ignoring me” or “perhaps something bad happened to him”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, for one, have my share of reasons why I do not answer right away:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-dont-like-canned-responses&quot;&gt;1. I don’t like canned responses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, I could answer right away “Ok, checking it now” or “Got it, will reply asap” but I’d be lying. Nothing hurts more than receiving answers like these which end up unrequited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some months ago I started adopting this small trick at work that is increasing my productivity: reply ASAP, deal with it later. Simply put, when you receive an email, you can reply with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear [NAME],&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for your email. Right now I can’t deal with this. Is it a problem if I come back to you in a week with an answer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Àlex&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Believe me, most people will be grateful for your honesty. Nothing is THAT urgent. Also, do not fail to deliver. If you promised a week, a week it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-want-to-check-all-my-sources&quot;&gt;2. I want to check all my sources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immediacy creates often times uncomfortable situations. I’ve had situations in which someone got mad at me because of an email they read incorrectly. But their problem is that I was not replying back. You see: instead of reading the email a second time to double-check the message, they thought it more appropriate to bomb my inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that very case, I remember I wanted to check what my email said before engaging into the conversation again. Turns out for whatever reason, I took some time to find a place to sit down and check it, but no longer than 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line here is: if I don’t reply, it might also mean I am checking my sources, verifying statements, analysing data or double-checking all the facts. I value your time, and I want you to focus on important stuff rather than on calling back and forth while I collect all the information needed in the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;priorities&quot;&gt;3. Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody has got priorities. Some things I value more than others. Right now, for instance, I try to keep a perfect balance between work, sport and social life. If something else appears, it will most likely not be a priority for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I do not have family time high in my priority life like most people do, and most of you know it. But I understand that you do, and I respect it religiously. And like family time, I could name dozens of other time-consuming endeavours that I will only deal with in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-is-not-really-urgent&quot;&gt;4. It is not really urgent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are, if something is urgent, you will call me. And if it’s really critical, you’ll make sure you contact me. Then I will take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the things we deem urgent are not urgent. We regard them urgent because we want to cross them off our to-do task right now. But in most cases, they can wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At last Peter learnt his lesson, that if you always tell lies, people will eventually stop believing you; and then when you’re telling the truth for a change, when you really need them to believe you, they won’t. — The Boy Who Cried Wolf — Traditional.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, when all your tasks/projects are urgent, none of them really are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you waited for 9 months to come to this world, you should be a little more patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you got to know me a little bit better. However, I want to get to know &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with these situations?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Reasons to Become an Entrepreneur</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/11/16/My-Reasons-to-Become-an-Entrepreneur.html" />
      <updated>2015-11-16T20:11:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/11/16/My-Reasons-to-Become-an-Entrepreneur</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20151111reasons.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151111reasons.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Solitude&quot; alt=&quot;Solitude&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Being a business developer and an active member of the entrepreneurial ecosystem of a big city gives you a lot of exposure. Not only that, but you get to meet all sorts of people: crazy solopreneurs, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@lexrodba/what-i-learnt-from-spain-s-leading-business-maverick-founder-of-grupo-anuntis-737c071be083&quot; title=&quot;What I learned from Spain's leading business maverick founder of Grupo Anuntis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;big business mavens&lt;/a&gt;, tech gurus, investors with shitloads of money, government people and all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always ask them what their story is because I believe that everybody’s got a story to tell. In return, I sometimes get asked about myself. The more people I talk to, the more I get the following question: &lt;i&gt;why did you decide to become an entrepreneur?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False myth:&lt;/strong&gt; Most entrepreneurs want to be their own bosses. Wrong. I never wanted to be my own boss. I always wanted to work at Google.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t until I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/good-and-bad-reasons-to-become-an-entrepreneur-decf0766de8d&quot; title=&quot;Good and bad reasons to become and entrepreneur&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this article by Dustin Moskovitz&lt;/a&gt;, where he listed good and bad reasons to be an entrepreneur, that I found my inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-bit-of-background&quot;&gt;A little bit of background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing my degree in Computer Science and getting my first professional experience in Munich, Germany, I moved back to Barcelona. I decided to work as a developer, but back in 2009 there weren’t many options besides the obvious “you need to endure 5 years in consulting and then you’ll be ready for something else”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I often state that I started too late my own business, the truth is I am very grateful for the time spent at the two companies I worked for: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deloitte.es/&quot; title=&quot;Deloitte&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Deloitte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vass.es&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;VASS&quot;&gt;VASS&lt;/a&gt;. In almost five years in consultancies, I learnt both how to do things &lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;, and how to do things &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most of all, I learnt the reasons why I wanted to set up my own business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-set-your-own-limits&quot;&gt;#1 To set your own limits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be a thing of my generation. But most of my friends and acquaintances were brought up by overprotective parenting methods. “&lt;i&gt;If you do this, you’ll get hurt&lt;/i&gt;”, “&lt;i&gt;if you pick up things from the floor you’ll get bacteria&lt;/i&gt;”, “&lt;i&gt;eating this is bad for your brain&lt;/i&gt;”…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were probably one of the first generations that could counter these established dogmas with facts &amp;amp; research. We first had CDs with encyclopaedias (Encarta) and then the Internet came along — but with that, I am not implying that everything on the Internet is true, I am just saying that we’ve got more sources than ever to contrast opinions and biased information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That applies to the professional world as well. I coded my first lines at age 8 — a calculator — and coded more or less frequently throughout middle- and high-school. I coded at home for fun, and I coded to help other people with their projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I landed my first position at Deloitte, I was pigeonholed as &lt;i&gt;Junior Programmer&lt;/i&gt;. In my first week, I was already correcting &amp;amp; refactoring the code written by the technical analysts in my project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily enough, in my second company, VASS, they were more flexible about that. Even if they also had the career plan, I was able to climb up faster than at the giant Deloitte. Not because I was more talented, intelligent or skilled than the rest, but simply because I was driven and motivated. That gave me a real boost of confidence in myself, but it also taught me that I didn’t want to belong to this business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have probably heard the famous “&lt;i&gt;no one gets fired for buying IBM&lt;/i&gt;”. Well, no one delegates important stuff on non-managing roles in such companies. Therefore, if I wanted to learn about managing, I had to look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over and over again I regarded myself to be more capable, competent and motivated than the people above me — even if I was really wrong about that. But I was motivated. I could do higher level stuff and I was ready to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that if you’re not part of the solution, then you’re part of the problem. So I decided to quit my job and test my hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years after that, running a successful business like &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;, I still keep pushing my limits to higher grounds. I have not regretted it a single second ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-get-out-of-the-comfort-zone&quot;&gt;#2 To get out of the comfort zone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another well-established myth is that everyone can be an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is plainly wrong. Some people want to live in their comfort zones, and that is perfectly OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people like to be led, some people want to lead. Some people want to work for other people while others want employees to work for them. Some people see their job as a chore while others see it as their passion. There’s room for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151111.gif&quot; title=&quot;Working on the computer&quot; alt=&quot;Working on the computer&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Some people want to spend 8 hours a day in an office pretending they’re working to get their paycheck at the end of the month.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, being an entrepreneur is tough, and I do not recommend it to everyone. There’s a saying that goes “&lt;i&gt;Entrepreneurship is living a few years of your life like most people won’t, so that you can spend the rest of your life like most people can’t&lt;/i&gt;”. This means: you will burn out, run out of money, lose friends, lose hair if you’re a man, work too much, sleep too little and other caveats. But all beginnings are hard, and very few people like to risk in order to achieve a better status in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors take risks in their wealth to reach a higher financial status later in life. Entrepreneurs do it with their lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not ready to invest in your life, you can’t be an entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-enhance-your-superpowers&quot;&gt;#3 To enhance your superpowers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe everyone builds their own projects in order to enhance their abilities. Good designers will freelance or start up a design studio. Good singers will join a band. Good coders will create tutorials or bootcamps, besides their steady jobs — just to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; is to make things happen. As a consultant, I understand my clients &amp;amp; partners needs and turn them into reality. I am good at discovering needs &amp;amp; satisfying them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also reckon my partners to be the best in their fields. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/xavier_redo&quot; title=&quot;Xavier Redó on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Xavi&lt;/a&gt;, our CTO, is the person I’d trust all my technological projects to, while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/jordi_vendrell&quot; title=&quot;Jordi Vendrell on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jordi&lt;/a&gt;, our COO, is an extremely efficient strategist to drive a company to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, as a company we want to give back to the community that helped us when we started. Not only did we develop the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bcn.cat/bcnstartupmap&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Startup Map&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barcelona Startup Map&lt;/a&gt; and brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.cat/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind to Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, but last week &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/10/26/We-Launched-Slack-For-The-Barcelona-Startup-Community/&quot; title=&quot;Slack community for Barcelona entrepreneurs and startups&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;we launched an open community for startups and entrepreneurs in Barcelona using Slack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what are your reasons to become an entrepreneur?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Learned from Spain's Business Maverick Founder of Grupo Anuntis</title>

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/10/16/What-i-learned-from-spain-business-maverick-founder-grupo-anuntis</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20151016.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151016.png&quot; title=&quot;Office&quot; alt=&quot;Office&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Part of my daily job is to meet the leading entrepreneurs and business people in Barcelona. Not only do I see them as candidate speakers for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;, but most of the times they will open new business doors for my company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com/&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;. But most of all, I like to learn from other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barely a month ago, I set out to meet one of the most influential Spanish businessmen ever: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidgonzalezcastro.com/en/&quot; title=&quot;David González Castro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David González Castro&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Grupo Anuntis (Segonamà, Coches.net, Fotocasa, etc.)  -  that was acquired by Schibsted back in 2013 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://digimedios.es/index.php/archivo/schibsted-compra-el-paquete-minoritario-que-aun-no-controlaba-en-anuntis-segundamano/&quot; title=&quot;Anuntis sold to Schibsted&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, in Spanish) - and I was taken aback by how little we know about successful business people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corporations-can-retain-a-human-touch&quot;&gt;Corporations Can Retain a Human Touch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have hired more than 100 people in a matter of weeks. I shut down all paper editions of our magazines in the blink of an eye and managed more than 1300 people in my company. But I don’t like that. I like to see things grow and the early stages of companies.  - David González Castro.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David did not only have the patience to accept my two or three date changes for the meeting, but he also welcomed me in his office with no time restrictions and gave me a free copy of his latest book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After breaking the ice, he proceeded to review his career and answer to all my questions without ever peering at his watch or agenda. He even was interrupted a couple of times by his assistant, but politely reminded her that he was in a meeting and would get back to whatever that was later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d be surprised if I said that I had never experienced this level of attention on a business meeting. Hats off to David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our one-and-a-half hour meeting, he proceeded to show me the offices and meet the staff at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.redarbor.net/&quot; title=&quot;Red Arbor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Red Arbor&lt;/a&gt;, which is the company he created to “feel like an entrepreneur again” and Infojobs Brazil, one of the projects they’re helping to grow at Red Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-in-the-alternate-reality-of-a-successful-founder&quot;&gt;Life in the Alternate Reality of a Successful Founder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I am learning from frequenting successful people is that some of them can feel ignored by the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same way one wouldn’t date to flirt with a really attractive member of the opposite sex, entrepreneurs or companies do not contact the big fish in the pond. “&lt;i&gt;They’re too big to pay me attention&lt;/i&gt;”, “&lt;i&gt;they’re out of my league&lt;/i&gt;”, “&lt;i&gt;I will only be wasting their time&lt;/i&gt;” and other silly thoughts pop up when trying to approach the people we look up to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some of them do really want to meet us. They love listening to our story and will try to help us. They might not have a lot of time for us, because it’s a matter of math: they might be meeting loads of people, therefore devoting little time to each one of them. But if you really click with them, you can use the 24- to 48-hour attention frame after the meeting to ask them anything. Go do it. In a way, we will be helping each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, they will be really appreciative if you are direct. “&lt;i&gt;Are you interested in investing in my project?&lt;/i&gt;”, “&lt;i&gt;would you like to become my mentor?&lt;/i&gt;”, “&lt;i&gt;does your company outsource development?&lt;/i&gt;” or other direct questions will have an immediate answer. Beating around the bush won’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not like people who waste your time, do not waste theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line here is: these people are most of the time helping back to the community they came from. It is therefore up to us to reach out, ask, and make stuff happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quitters-never-win&quot;&gt;Quitters Never Win&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Quitters never win&lt;/i&gt;” is one of the most used and reused quote when talking about successful businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read his book christened “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidgonzalezcastro.com/en/post/The_Presentation_of_The_Conviction.aspx&quot; title=&quot;La Convicción&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Conviction&lt;/a&gt;” and really enjoyed it. It is a description of his career, with all the highs and lows, explained with accessible language for everyone. No KPIs, no CACs, no reporting or details of investment rounds. Only easy language for everyone to understand. I really appreciated this and will be passing the book onto everyone I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an owner of a 30-year-old business, David had to endure multiple crisis, with the dotcom bubble burst being the toughest. I learned a lot from what he did to keep the company alive: taking risky decisions, some more popular than others, but he did not quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not quit when computers started to take over the digital design world. He adopted this technology way before everybody else in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not quit when the Internet menaced to compete with paper publications. He learnt from that and tried it in his company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not quit when the Internet &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; posed a threat to paper publications. He invested in technology and the Internet more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not quit when the dotcom bubble burst. He pivoted the company to be 100% digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did not quit in any of the multiple times he was approached by huge corporations to buy his company. He studied the options, waited, and finally took the best offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to welcoming him on stage for our February edition of Startup Grind Barcelona. I’m sure it will be our best event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have you learnt from successful entrepreneurs and businesspeople in your network?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking Back to 2014 (Part 2)</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/10/11/Looking-Back-to-2014-part2.html" />
      <updated>2015-10-11T22:32:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/10/11/Looking-Back-to-2014-part2</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20151011.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151111.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Metro&quot; alt=&quot;Barcelona Metro&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Some months ago I reflected on my past year and wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/01/08/Looking-back-to-2014-part1.html&quot; title=&quot;Looking back to 2014 part 1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a small piece about it&lt;/a&gt;. 2014 was, without a doubt, the best year of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having seen out the first half of 2015 I can’t really complain, and I can now compare it to the first half of 2014 as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue that story where I left it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-return&quot;&gt;The return&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my life-changing experience in San Francisco, I returned to Barcelona with a mission: make a big dent in the entrepreneurial scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back from San Francisco — and especially if going back to Spain — one needs to slow down &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt;. Life has a different pace in each city, but the dramatic speed at which SF operates can’t be found anywhere else. Let alone in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in SF an email won’t go nor unread neither unreplied, in Barcelona you might wait for a week or two for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SF, you can find competing startups or initiatives team up to reach a higher goal. In Barcelona, they won’t even talk at the same event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SF, people meet for 10 minutes and get out of the meeting with two commitments for the next 24 hours, and the follow-up email is sent on the way back to the office. In Barcelona, people like to chat for hours at meetings without meeting any conclusion, agreement or immediate actions. Follow-up emails are not mandatory, here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list could go on, but I think you got the point already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-marsbased-take-off&quot;&gt;The MarsBased take-off&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finding a small project in San Francisco, it was time to deploy our operations in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that time, I was the only full-time member of the company, while my other two partners kept their steady job. Therefore, I had to work my ass off to find projects so that we could incorporate them as soon as possible. There was no way I could do this alone, and we all knew it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, though, we were presented with the option to develop the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bcn.cat/bcnstartupmap&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Startup Map&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barcelona Startup Map&lt;/a&gt; and the new platform of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eureka-experts.com/&quot; title=&quot;Eureka Experts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eureka-Experts&lt;/a&gt;. Those two projects gave us enough money to incorporate our CTO, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/xavier_Redo&quot; title=&quot;Xavier Redó on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Xavi&lt;/a&gt; and start earning some bucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151111map.png&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Startup Map&quot; alt=&quot;Barcelona Startup Map&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Might be the 1000th time I share this screenshot, but I’m actually very proud of how this project came along.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should probably mention that after six months unemployed, almost three of them in San Francisco, I went broke. This was a life-changing experience I don’t recommend to anyone, but it served me a lot. I kept my priorities straight and hastened to find new means to sustain myself economically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after less than three months operating with only a third of the crew, and by working on weekends and late at night, MarsBased started to take off and had a very interesting summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;startup-grind&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While MarsBased took some time to start up, the Grind functioned admirably since the get-go. I am amazed at how much we have improved since the beginning, even though we had a really good start back then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will cover this more extensively in another post, but in order to avoid a completely messy first event, we programmed our failure. We decided to release the MVE (Minimum Viable Event) to test stuff before we charged people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startup Grind is a paid event. That helps to attract like-minded people who are genuinely interested in the event, and not pizza bums. But at the time, there were not many paid events in Barcelona. Most events here are free and they include a beer or two thanks to big brands like Estrella Damm or Moritz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month before our first official event with Marc Vicente (Rakuten), we scheduled a free presentation event. Setting a deadline for that, allowed us to focus on getting stuff done, so by that date, we completed the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.cat/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, we got &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/89865217&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a very nice video&lt;/a&gt;, plus we were able to give free catering thanks to our buddies at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dribbledots.com/&quot; title=&quot;Dribble Dots&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dribble Dots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151111grind.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Yeah, right. If you were sitting in the fourth row or further, all you could see were other people’s heads.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The event was rather mediocre and seemed highly unprepared, but it gave us all the answers we needed. We needed a bigger venue, more preparation and to follow the feedback we received after the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20151111networking.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Despite everything, we had a very good attendance and the general vibe was very good.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to that test event, we conducted a very successful series of events from April to September, hosting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-barcelona-hosted-marc-vicente-rakuten#/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Marc Vicente&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marc Vicente (Rakuten)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-barcelona-hosted-anna-closas-the-social-coin#/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Anna Closas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anna Closas (The Social Coin)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-barcelona-hosted-miquel-puig-barcelona-soccer-academy#/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Miquel Puig&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mike Puig (FC Barcelona School)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-barcelona-hosted-marcos-alves-eltenedor-es#/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Marcos Alves&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marcos Alves (Eltenedor.es)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-barcelona-hosted-karen-prats-popplaces#/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Karen Prats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karen Prats (Popplaces)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s for the second part of the year. All in all, very challenging months and extremely rewarding. The effort of the preceding months started to pay off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, the most important accomplishments of 2014 were about to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to share my experiences here, but I would like to learn more about yours. What was your best moment in 2014?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Can Gamification Help Your Company Get More Users</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/09/24/How-can-gamification-help-your-company-more-users.html" />
      <updated>2015-09-24T22:32:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/09/24/How-can-gamification-help-your-company-more-users</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150924.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150924.png&quot; title=&quot;Chess&quot; alt=&quot;Chess&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Startups are on the rise, making entrepreneurship as fashionable as rock stardom. The best side of this development is the huge role startups are beginning to play in the job market. Once perceived as unstable, risky and low paying, modern startups are offering the best salaries and job conditions out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of that, it is not strange that newly-graduates seek their first job in the startup market, leaving big, traditional, companies as a second option or a last resort. The dynamic and work-hard-play-hard attitude is perceived as appealing among the youngest job-seekers. Thus, companies with a more traditional mindset will have to adapt to the market lest they run out of candidates for their openings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 27th, we hosted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startupgrind.com/events/details/startup-grind-barcelona-presents-oscar-garcia-panella-cookiebox#&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosts Oscar García-Pañella&quot;&gt;Dr. Oscar García-Pañella&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/strong&gt; to talk about gamification,  and learned three ways gamification can help companies overcome hiring and retention before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamification is, according to Dr. García-Pañella, &lt;i&gt;making an experience evolve from miserable to memorable to make people voluntarily achieve their goals&lt;/i&gt;. Here’s how it can help companies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;connecting-with-millennials&quot;&gt;Connecting with Millennials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call them millennials, digital natives, or Gen Yers, but they uniformly have a different concept of life and work balance. Because they belong to a different generation, we can’t treat the same way we’ve treated 30 year industry loyalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials are much more tech-savvy and are deeply familiar with gaming. They grew up playing or being around people who played video games, many first being exposed by their own parents. They’ve been hands-on with technology since the early stages of their childhood. The adoption of mobile phones in the middle of the 90s, video-game sets and now tablets have made millennial exceptionally savvy with technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Millennials are used to exploring virtual worlds through the Internet, whether in World of Warcraft or Minecraft; collect rewards and badges from gamified apps like Swarm or Fitocracy; and they know how to keep up with technology changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, companies can use gamification in HR to attract them as early as in their selection processes. Career plans, company perks and other great traits of company culture can be explained through gamification, increasing talent retention and employee happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quoting a conference Dr. García-Pañella attended while his stay in the USA, he exemplified how gamification helps our learning process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;During our school days, we are forced to learn the periodic table. A hundred and fifty elements of very important stuff. After all, we're made of that stuff, and so is the Universe. However, because we are forced to learn it, we vomit it in the final exam and never get back to it unless we pursue Chemistry or Bio-Chemistry degrees. All in all, a very unpleasant experience.

On the other hand, take a look at the Pokémon game series. There are over 800 creatures there. Each one has its own evolutions, skills, attack moves and they can be mixed to create new species. Pokémon is way more complicated and complex than the periodic table, but we learn them all by heart by age seven.

Isn't it strange that by age fourteen a teacher must point a gun to our head to learn 150 elements? Obviously, we are doing something very wrong.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;engage-through-the-heart&quot;&gt;Engage through the Heart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. García-Pañella added that gamification offers a way to connect with your employees through untraditional methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While in the traditional companies a more conservative and rational approach is taken, where they try to engage with us through the brain - salaries, big projects, and career plans - gamification does it differently - through the heart.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gamification allows people to express themselves more freely, through a fictional character or their own accomplishments. This, when combined with a good plot, strong audiovisuals, and serious games, can empower self-expression for a more genuine communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Dr. García-Pañella put it: &lt;i&gt;“… when combined with cinema, we found that people engage deeper with our gamification projects. Cinema is a universal language, and everybody is alphabetized in cinema. Everybody speaks that language”&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way, employees can feel more attached to the company’s mission if gamification is applied properly as an integral part of the HR strategy for employee self-realization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;When we understand something through the heart, we do not forget it. We're in the so-called suspension of disbelief. We feel like floating in space, and time does not matter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;revitalizing-the-old-school&quot;&gt;Revitalizing the Old School&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If what we’ve been doing for years is falling apart and companies are losing their best employees regularly to risky ventures, we need to try something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking the mold of traditional HR practices can lead to unexplored grounds. Cookiebox, where Dr. García-Pañella is a Partner, specialise in transmedia. They create complete gamified experiences using cinema, audio, storytelling, comics and video-games to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Companies are desperate to try new stuff. Old methods do not work anymore, and that’s where we come in”&lt;/i&gt; says Dr. García-Pañella, implying that a generational change is happening now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you part of that change? How is gamification influencing your life? Let us know in the comments section below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Incorporate Sport into Your Daily Routine</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/09/22/How-to-Incorporate-Sport-into-Your-Daily-Routine.html" />
      <updated>2015-09-22T10:32:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/09/22/How-to-Incorporate-Sport-into-Your-Daily-Routine</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150922.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150922.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Time&quot; alt=&quot;Time&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; You are a busy person and you want to get in shape. You might or not be exercising every now and then, but you want to become more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my last entry, I wrote about how to organise your daily routine, based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/09/03/Time-vs-Attention-vs-Priorities.html&quot; title=&quot;Time vs. Attention vs. Priorities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time, Attention and Priorities&lt;/a&gt;. I assume you’ve got the theory, let’s now put it in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have proved that sport is good for your health and your mood, but everybody has got a different reason to practise sport. Some want to get fit, some are healthily addicted by it, some want to build up muscle, some need to exercise to fight back some sort of condition, while others enjoy doing team sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MarsBased, we encourage our employees to exercise to battle the effects of seating all day long. We wrote about it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2014/07/21/Sport-on-Rails/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Sport on Rails&quot;&gt;our blog&lt;/a&gt;, a while back ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been successfully combining sport and work for many years now. I hope you can learn from what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;block-time-in-your-calendar&quot;&gt;1. Block time in your calendar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150922calendar.png&quot; title=&quot;Calendar&quot; alt=&quot;Calendar&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;This is what my calendar looked like on Sunday. In hindsight, the exercise order makes little to no sense to me right now.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to plan my week on Sunday evening so that I could squeeze in two or three workouts a week. I started off like this, then I progressively increased the number of workouts, shortening the duration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never too strict about this, but it helped me to think constantly about doing sport. Or, better: it helped me &lt;i&gt; not to forget about doing sport&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy. Think of it as blocking time for a meeting, for lunch with a friend or for your children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-over-exercise&quot;&gt;2. Don’t over-exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more often you exercise, the shorter your workouts should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s perfectly OK to go to the gym twice a week, if your workouts are effective, you eat healthily and you rest accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s also perfectly OK to exercise a little bit every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you go beyond your limits you seriously risk injuries that can set you out for a long time. Best case scenario, you will only have muscle fever, that you will need to shake off in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also very wise not to rush it at the beginning when you’re extra-motivated. Working out five days in a row and then quitting forever is nothing short of useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-make-it-painful&quot;&gt;3. Don’t make it painful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising shouldn’t be seen as an obligation nor as something boring or tiring. When we perceive something is a chore or an obligation, we tend to look for excuses to skip doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typical excuses include: “&lt;i&gt;The gym is too far away&lt;/i&gt;”, “&lt;i&gt;I can’t afford a gym pass&lt;/i&gt;” or “&lt;i&gt;I spend too much time in the gym&lt;/i&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your gym too far? Get a closer one or exercise at home. Is your gym too expensive? Look for a cheaper one, look out for promotions/discounts or else get a job that includes gym pass (there are more than you think). Does it take too much time to go to the gym, park, exercise, shower, etc? This process can be optimised. There are solutions for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-advice&quot;&gt;4. Get advice&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution to all the excuses we found in the previous section can be solved with professional advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off by learning from a gym-rat workmate and some professional trainers &amp;amp; nutritionists that spared me from doing rookie mistakes. They also got me into thinking in the long-run, not in immediate results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress enough how important it is to trust professionals. Do not believe everything you read on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These past few months I’ve been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.8fit.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;8fit&quot;&gt;8fit&lt;/a&gt; as my personal coach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8fit offers free workout programs that you can do at home, without any equipment whatsoever, for as short as 3–15 minutes each. This way you cannot complain about inconvenience: you can work out at home for barely 10 minutes a day or wherever/whenever you want literally &lt;i&gt;for free&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you opt in to buy the PRO version, you get a personal coach, diets &amp;amp; nutrition and more personalised workout programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercising couldn’t get any easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;i&gt;I do not work at/for 8fit, am neither an investor there nor hold any special interest in the company. I am just a happy user&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am eager to hear how you included sport in your daily routine or how can I help you do it. Let’s talk in the comments section below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150903.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150903.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Lluís Font&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Lluís Font&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Good heavens! Looks like I won’t have time to watch Spongebob Squarepants today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard these words in the last two weeks? &lt;i&gt;“I don’t have time for this”&lt;/i&gt;. Or even worse: &lt;i&gt;“I didn’t call you because I couldn’t find time for it”&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously? You did not find a minute and a half in the 11520 minutes your week has to do a phone call? My day has got 24 hours, and so has yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read this article by Jason Fried recently, where he made some good points about &lt;a href=&quot;https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3919-the-difference-between-time-and-attention&quot; title=&quot;The difference between time and attention&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the difference between time and attention&lt;/a&gt;. Long story short, the sentence &lt;i&gt;“I don’t have time for this”&lt;/i&gt; more often than not means &lt;i&gt;“Even if I find the time for it, I do not have the required attention to deal with this”&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think he’s a hundred percent right about it, the article feels somehow incomplete. The author doesn’t deal with another dimension of the problem: priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;time-vs-attention&quot;&gt;Time vs. Attention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid evolution of our information-based society is stealing our attention, but we are simply too busy to even notice. Or worse: we notice, but we don’t find this worthy of our attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between finding time to do something and having attention to do something is the amount of grey matter we’re going to use while dealing with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can find time to take out the trash every night or to perform mechanical tasks at the end of the day. However, we might not have the required attention to focus on choosing the right words for the followup email you’re supposed to send at the end of the day, or to proofread your next blog entry before going to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears to me, that when we’re dealing with unexpected tasks that are flooding our daily agenda, we should decide whether they require time or attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks requiring attention&lt;/strong&gt; (thus, concentration, planning, creativity, decision-making, etc.) should be placed at the beginning of the day or delegated to trustworthy people — if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks requiring time&lt;/strong&gt; (thus, none of the above) should be placed at the end of the day or else — when possible — outsourced. Your time is usually too valuable to deal with such chores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-priorities&quot;&gt;Enter Priorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason Fried didn’t make clear how does he tell a task that requires time from one that requires attention instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My guess is &lt;i&gt;priorities&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once read this story: Imagine your job is really exhausting, even physically. After a ten hours shift, you decide to go to the gym, because that helps you dealing with stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your way back home, a friend calls you to go for a walk. You politely decline the invite, as you’re &lt;i&gt;too tired&lt;/i&gt;. A minute after, you receive a second call alerting you that your house is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can bet a thousand dollars you’d run like you’ve never run before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got the point? If that intern’s email were higher on his priorities list, he would have dealt with it. Instead, it got pushed back many times. Jason probably took some days off from work this summer, like pretty much everybody, but still he did not reply to the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not wrong. It’s called &lt;i&gt;priorities&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;priorities-driven-decisions&quot;&gt;Priorities-driven decisions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I too fell in the trap of considering myself too busy to do anything. Some days I would not go out for drinks, meet family, or go to the gym because I had too much stuff to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of a ligaments injury I had back in May, I haven’t been able to go running as much as I used to, and combined with an excess of work, I put on about 10kg in less than three months. I also eat a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I not have the time to eat less or work out differently? Most likely. Did I have the attention? Don’t know. But one thing is clear: fitness dropped in my priorities list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to change my priorities: Work would still be up there, but fitness should definitely win over other lesser priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prove myself that there’s always time to squeeze something else in your packed agenda, I joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/200daysof8fit&quot; title=&quot;200DaysOf8fit challenge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#200DaysOf8fit challenge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.8fit.com/&quot; title=&quot;8fit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;8fit&lt;/a&gt; is a fitness app that launched this challenge internally, but decided to open it up as it gained followers. The challenge consists in working out 200 days in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made this a &lt;i&gt;priority&lt;/i&gt;. Therefore I will decline offers to go for drinks or my own temptations to slack off at home if that interferes with my daily workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-sum-up&quot;&gt;To sum up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order to be more productive, you should learn how to prioritise tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once they are ordered, tackle first the attention-consuming tasks early in the day. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/23/eisenhower-decision-matrix/&quot; title=&quot;Eisenhower matrix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eisenhower matrix&lt;/a&gt; works wonders for me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave tasks that require time but no attention for the end of the day. If nobody else can do them but you, deal with them. Else, delegate/outsource/eliminate that task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom! How does your agenda look like now? Have more time to do stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong: your day has still got 24 hours. Exactly the same amount of time before you read this post. You just learnt how to use it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Zyncro's Lluís Font on 5 Sales Secrets that Earned His First Big Exit</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/08/27/Zyncro-Lluis-Font-on-5-Sales-Secrets-that-Earned-His-First-Big-Exit.html" />

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/08/27/Zyncro-Lluis-Font-on-5-Sales-Secrets-that-Earned-His-First-Big-Exit</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150827.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150827.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Lluís Font&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona hosted Lluís Font&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; The experts are in, and they agree: &lt;a href=&quot;http://calacanis.com/2015/07/04/the-most-important-piece-of-advice-for-folks-starting-their-careers/&quot; title=&quot;The most important piece of advice for folks starting their careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sales is some of the most important&lt;/a&gt; fuel for startups – yet very few companies seem to execute the fundamentals perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the excess of information in social media seem to drag startups into distracting endeavors, such as hiring community managers, getting into the hottest social networks, or trying to create viral content – all before having a complete product or even defining their sales strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our last Startup Grind Barcelona event, we hosted one of the most renowned sales people in the entire country, Lluís Font. Among his accomplishments, Lluís took Zyncro to an international level and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20141105100508-314702-la-venta-de-zyncro-mi-historia&quot; title=&quot;La venta de Zyncro, mi historia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sold it last year to Desarrolladora Río Paraná for 30M €&lt;/a&gt;. To continue putting his energy and hustle to use, he now mentors at Kompyte and leads Captio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fireside chat revolved around sales for startups, and this is what we learnt from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-introverts-no-extroverts&quot;&gt;1. No Introverts, No Extroverts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When confronted with the question “what makes a better salesman, an introvert person or an extrovert one?” most people would choose the extrovert. However, Lluís pointed out some studies that say that extrovert people have poorer empathic skills because they don’t listen as carefully as introverts. Sales require understanding of your customer’s needs – where extroverts are at a clear disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That does not make an introvert a perfect salesman either. Introverts usually lack the communication skills or the drive to go out and talk to people they don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, according to Lluís, the perfect salesman is someone in between these two classifications. Someone who can listen and understand the client, and at the same time is able to convey clearly his message and reach out to unknown people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-sales-hacking&quot;&gt;2. Use Sales Hacking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lluís pointed out that traditional sales processes are on the decline. As markets and companies evolve, so do their processes. Therefore, it is imperative to break away from old school traditional sales methodologies and start thinking outside of the box. He himself did it ten years ago, ahead of his time, but now there is no excuse not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools that did not exist ten years ago are having a major impact on sales teams, making it much easier to get information regardless of where we are (Evernote), manage our sales funnel on mobile devices (PipeDrive) or check whether our email has been read (Mailtrack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the concept of Sales Hacking. Sales Hacking is loosely defined as using creative techniques that aim to increase sales by using tools, channels and data in a disruptive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;http://findthatlead.com/&quot; title=&quot;Find That Lead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FindThatLead&lt;/a&gt;, one of our favorite startups in Barcelona, posted a job opening in the main online recruiting platforms looking for salesmen. That way, they earned loads of contacts in the sales area, many of which turned into customers of their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-work-for-entrepreneurs&quot;&gt;3. Don’t Work for Entrepreneurs&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lluís asked the audience who the worst customer is - and it took many by surprise. It’s not big companies, not startups, and not even the government.. Lluís was adamant about this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The worst customer you will have is the one-man project entrepreneur. That guy that is risking his marriage, all his reputation, his friends and his last pennies on you will be the most demanding customer. He will make dead sure you complete every task, petition a million changes overnight in order to satisfy investors, delay the payments, discuss every clause on the contract... it is too energy-draining and totally not worth it. Avoid these clients.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every 20 customers of this category, you’ll find one or two great customers. According to Lluís, it may even be a bank, as it was for him, and it can transform your entire business. Save your energy for the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-your-research&quot;&gt;4. Do Your Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about his biggest mistake in business, he brought the audience back to his consulting years. Lluís was selling a popular Spanish product for remote administration of computers. It was successful among local corporations, but the company soon decided to attempt entry into the US market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With no research and poor preparation, the product failed terribly: it didn’t meet the American standards for quality, it was not visually attractive, it had way too many options – all which contributed to making it a complete failure in the eyes of the American customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning the customer’s needs would have taken a fraction of the time and cost as pursuing an expansion plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparation-is-essential&quot;&gt;5. Preparation is essential&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Startups should not always trust their gut, contrary to popular belief. According to Lluís, preparation is 90% of a sale, leaving only 10% to other arbitrary criteria, such as luck, intuition, or charm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researching the customer’s company, finding out who the decision makers are, understanding their needs, writing personalized offers trying to add value to their company, or offering them free content are just some of the many strategies one can use to warm and close a good contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lluís was full of sales advice, and these tips just begin to scratch the surface. A sales expert yourself? What is your best advise for founders hustling on distribution and promotion of their product? Let us know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Favourite Tools for Blogging</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/08/22/My-favourite-tools-for-blogging.html" />
      <updated>2015-08-22T10:32:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/08/22/My-favourite-tools-for-blogging</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150822.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150822.png&quot; title=&quot;Tools&quot; alt=&quot;Tools&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/07/06/My-Tools-of-Choice.html&quot; title=&quot;My Tools of Choice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my post of my favourite tools&lt;/a&gt;, I was asked by a fellow colleague to share my blogging tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually blog regularly in three different places. You can read me here, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marsbased.com/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my company’s blog&lt;/a&gt; or writing for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot;&gt;Startup Grind&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Startup Grind has got a tool of their own to publish content, I will not be covering it here. Instead, I will focus on what I use when I blog for MarsBased or for my personal Medium account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your needs, you might want to go for an existing blogging solution such as Wordpress or Blogger, or build a blog of your own. Because I don’t have a dog in the fight of which one is better, I won’t be giving the pros and cons of each one. Instead, I will tell you how to use each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;build-your-own-blog-jekyll--sublime&quot;&gt;Build your own blog: Jekyll + Sublime&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MarsBased we used Jekyll to create our website. Jekyll is a Rails-powered static site creator, which in non-nerdy language translate to “create a website using plain text and no databases”. If you’re interested in reading more about it, take a look &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you load a Jekyll project in your text editor of choice, it creates a hierarchical structure of your site. In my case, I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/&quot; title=&quot;Sublime Text&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sublime text&lt;/a&gt;: a really useful text editor with loads of plugins to power it up — very popular among developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Jekyll project structure there are some folders, but what you need to know here is that files included in the &lt;i&gt;_posts&lt;/i&gt; directory will be published as a new blog entry once the site is pushed live, provided they follow certain rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Posts must be named &lt;i&gt;year-month-day-title.md&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;year-month-day-title.markdown&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to fill in the parameters in the top part of the file (layout, title, date, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150822sublime.png&quot; title=&quot;Sublime&quot; alt=&quot;Sublime&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Black windows for the extra haxX0r look.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are some parameters and HTML, so if you’re not into coding, you will need to learn some concepts. However, it’s very straightforward and easy to learn for non-technical people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s wonderful how the content in the screenshot above translates into &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com/blog&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a full-powered blog like ours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-an-existing-blogging-platform-medium&quot;&gt;Use an existing blogging platform: Medium&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, Medium is THE tool for writing. It is simple, beautiful and straightforward: perfect for distraction-free blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium focuses on content. Once you sign up, you’re prompted to write right away: no plugins, no setup, no look&amp;amp;feel tweaking, no nothing. That’s why I chose it over Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your story will look beautiful from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medium also offers some insights on whether you’ve got followers or not. One thing I really appreciate is the stats screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150822medium.png&quot; title=&quot;Medium&quot; alt=&quot;Medium&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Stats for human beings.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No complex analytics stuff, no setup. Just simple stats for human beings: how many people read your article, how far did they read into it, and how many people shared it through their recommendation system. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage for beginners is that Medium provides an user base. You can start building your own fanbase before you migrate your own blog elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, you can use Medium to complement your regular blogging platform. For instance, I created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com/@marsbased&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased on Medium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medium account for MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; to test our blog posts on this platform. I repost all our posts there to see whether our audience behaves the same way as on our website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, one of our best posts had a lot of views, and we received a request to add it to one Collection. Collections are compilations of related content from multiple authors on Medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/navigating-organizational-change&quot; title=&quot;Navigating Organizational Change&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Navigating organizational change&lt;/a&gt; included our post about our tips for working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150822collection.png&quot; title=&quot;Medium Collections&quot; alt=&quot;Medium Collections&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Thank you guys!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scheduling-trello&quot;&gt;Scheduling: Trello&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Trello for everything. Trello is my tool of choice to organize and plan what I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello is actually a list-based task-managing tool. It’s very common among developers because it’s based on GTD methodologies so you can see the real status of a task/sprint/project in a glimpse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also be used for non-technical projects: normal people (as in non-developers) use it to plan their holidays, their wedding, or what-have-you.
200
At MarsBased we use Trello to manage our projects, our selection processes, our relationships with other companies and many other things. Since I am in charge of the blog, I also keep a board with our writing schedule which looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150822trello.png&quot; title=&quot;Trello&quot; alt=&quot;Trello&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Witness the awesomeness of our board!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I add all the ideas I’ve got to the &lt;i&gt;Article Ideas&lt;/i&gt; list, which move promptly to the next lists as soon as they’re ready to go into the next stage (researching, writing, revision and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could create a simpler board with less states, but basically I use the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article ideas:&lt;/b&gt; Include any idea you’ve got here to come back to it later. The higher on the list a it is, the more likely it is to be dragged onto the next stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Researching:&lt;/b&gt; I try to have the next two or three blog posts here. It helps me start reading about the topic or collecting the information I need (links to other articles, references, quotes, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Writing:&lt;/b&gt; Ideally you will not have more than a post here.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Revision:&lt;/b&gt; I drag the post here when I submit it to my team-mates to get their feedback. Specially useful if your team has a revision workflow or it it’s being spell-checked by someone else. The 99% of the post is done, you’re just adding details, formatting, adding the cover image, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ready to publish:&lt;/b&gt; When the post is ready but you don’t want to publish it just yet. For instance, we try to publish on Monday, so if I finish the post by Thursday, it’ll wait here. You can also write posts for special days and leave them here with a due date (Anniversary, New Year’s, April Fools, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; Once a post enters this stage, it means it has already been published. You can get rid of this stage, but I use it to keep track of our history, by adding the date I published every post in the title of the card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the cards, you‘ve got even more options to help you organise. Let’s cover the most important ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Labels:&lt;/b&gt; Useful to filter when you want to get a really quick overview of the whole board.
Due date: Get reminders to get your writing done. Useful if you’re working with other people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assigned to:&lt;/b&gt; Important if your team has more than one writer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Description:&lt;/b&gt; Use this to include an outline of the post, references or generally just braindump all you want to write here to get back to it later.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attachments:&lt;/b&gt; Use them to save the images or files you need to link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the labels, let me explain it a little bit better: I’ve got some labels that indicate where does that post go (Startup Grind, this Medium or the MarsBased blog), there’s another one that indicates that the post is a collaborative one (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsbased.com/blog/2015/06/15/Six-Tips-for-Remote-Working&quot; title=&quot;Our Six Tips for Remote Working&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) and the other labels — CTO, CMO, CEO — indicate who is the target reader for each entry. This helps me defining the language level and the topic I should cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150822labels.png&quot; title=&quot;Trello&quot; alt=&quot;Trello&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Use the labels wisely and you’ll increase your productivity. Also, see that the description includes a couple of source posts I might use as a reference.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/07/06/My-Tools-of-Choice.html" />
      <updated>2015-07-06T10:32:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/07/06/My-Tools-of-Choice</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150706.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150706.png&quot; title=&quot;Tools&quot; alt=&quot;Tools&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; I had always been reading these oddly-timed lists of personal favourite tools &amp;amp; services by major influencers and journalists right before the holidays. I found them exotic, to know what tools befit every one of them, and useful, because they allow me to discover new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2015/06/28/products-i-love-to-use/&quot; title=&quot;Products I love to use&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mark Suster’s very own list&lt;/a&gt;, and felt compelled to share mine. Not that I am an influencer or anyone particularly interesting, but every now and then I find myself engaging into very interesting conversations where the other person often doesn’t know a product I’m praising or just talking about. And often times, he or she comes back to me to thank me for having mentioned the product, which turned to be a game-changer for him or her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list only covers the apps I use that couldn’t be replaced by the competition because of different criteria and that have changed my life for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;1. Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cliché as it sounds, Twitter is my number one tool nowadays. One of the first things I read every morning, and the last one I scrutinise at night before heading off to bed.
Twitter has helped me spread the word about both my company &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; and my other endeavours such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;. Not only that, but I’ve met really cool people with whom I engaged via Twitter as well. Some of them I had never met before in real life, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155167421940704&amp;amp;set=a.10152452073425704.956374.566650703&amp;amp;type=1&quot; title=&quot;Photos with Mr. Scott Eddy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;when I met Mr. Scott Eddy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter feeds me with breaking news instantly, personal (almost) unfiltered opinions by leaders of thought, the post-game reactions of my favourite football players and the best content of my comedians of choice. From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/pmarca&quot; title=&quot;Marc Andreessen on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@pmarca&lt;/a&gt;’s Tweetstorms, to my daily dose of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/explosm&quot; title=&quot;Cyanide and Happiness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cyanide and Happiness&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter’s the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slack&quot;&gt;2. Slack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we adopted Slack at MarsBased, our life has changed for the better. If you ask me, Slack should become a &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; standard for company chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there’ll always be the Atlassian lovers, with all their Confluence and JIRA built in, tied to HipChat. I even have a HipChat t-shirt I got at Startup Grind 2014, but I’m a Slack guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150706slack.png&quot; title=&quot;Slack&quot; alt=&quot;Slack&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Troll. Really troll.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flawless mobile experience, the clear user interface, the “let’s do less stuff but really solidly” wins me every time. Our company is based on simplicity, so we love simple tools that work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/04/07/Doing-business-with-your-friends-or-family.html&quot; title=&quot;Doing business with your friends or family&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;creating the company with my two best friends&lt;/a&gt;. With them, I chat over Slack. It’s that good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate with Giphy for the ultimate chatting experience. A gif is worth a million words, sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pocket&quot;&gt;3. Pocket&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must admit I’m a terrible Pocket user. I pocket everything I don’t feel like reading at the moment and then end up rarely ever checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in those days where you feel like procrastinating or else feel forced to be offline, Pocket comes as a blessing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my worst mistake was to feed my Pocket with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifttt.com/&quot; title=&quot;IFTTT&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;direct from RSS feeds when Google Reader shut down. Apart from that, I’ve thoroughfully enjoyed the experience from the ReadItLater days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150706pocket.png&quot; title=&quot;Pocket&quot; alt=&quot;Pocket&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Things I want to do, but don’t know when will I tackle them. Millions, actually.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, Pocket is my backlog for personal tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;evernote&quot;&gt;4. Evernote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish all tools I use would be that innovative and that creative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150706evernote.png&quot; title=&quot;Evernote&quot; alt=&quot;Evernote&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Planning my holidays to Greece.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evernote is always pushing to take the user experience to a higher level. And like most companies, sometimes they hit the right key, sometimes they fail, but they never stop trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evernote is also, most possibly, one of the only companies whose all apps (desktop, web &amp;amp; mobile) are brilliant. Kudos to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’re my brain, so I don’t have to remember anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;trello&quot;&gt;5. Trello&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello has replaced so many apps in my life it’s not even funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello killed Wunderlist because most tasks I do are not “todo/done” tasks. They have states (backlog, planned, sent, blocked, ready to publish, done, etc.) and therefore they befit Trello better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150706trello.png&quot; title=&quot;Trello&quot; alt=&quot;Trello&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;I plan the MarsBased blog entries using Trello as well.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello killed Any.do when I wanted a great mobile experience. Sure, Any.do’s mobile apps are killer, but they messed with the calendar so badly, I had to remove them. Having a quick look at Trello, I can see my planning for the upcoming weeks at a project level. Also for my personal tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trello also killed email and other collaboration tools such as Google docs or Redbooth, when a simple Trello card was sufficient. It also killed planning apps, that bloggers use to schedule their posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MarsBased we also use Trello for our recruitment processes, to manage the availability of our own team &amp;amp; the freelancers we outsource some of our work to, to keep track of our relations with other companies, and up until recently, to control the sales funnel (this was until we moved to PipeDrive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will actually blog about that in our next entries, for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus points:&lt;/strong&gt; The Trello pet is called “Taco”. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mailtrack&quot;&gt;6. Mailtrack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150706mailtrack.png&quot; title=&quot;Mailtrack&quot; alt=&quot;Mailtrack&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Oh, your email must’ve ended in the spam folder! — ORLY?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote about my love for MailTrack a couple of entries ago. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mailtrack.io/&quot; title=&quot;Mailtrack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MailTrack&lt;/a&gt; is Whatsapp’s double-checks in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not the kind of person that needs to know whether you read an email or not, but it will surely help me modulate my next conversation with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, when writing follow-up emails, knowing whether your potential customer has read the email or not, will allow you pose different questions and lead the conversation avoiding the uncomfortable “I didn’t read your email” or even worse “I haven’t received any email”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus points:&lt;/strong&gt; Combine it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.findthatlead.com/&quot; title=&quot;Findthatlead&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FindThatLead&lt;/a&gt; to find that email account you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fit&quot;&gt;7. 8fit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All work, no play, makes a Jack a dull boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We nowadays spent a vicious amount of time sitting: by the computer, at meetings, in an office, eating, watching TV shows, etc. Our body is not designed for that, and leading an active life does wonders to your health. Sitting does simply not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried many fitness apps in the past, but none of them engages with beginners like &lt;a href=&quot;http://8fit.com/&quot; title=&quot;8fit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;8fit&lt;/a&gt;. Led by Redbooth founder &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/micho&quot; title=&quot;Pablo Villalba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pablo Villalba&lt;/a&gt;, 8fit duly delivers what it promises: fitness for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8fit makes you feel like your workouts have a meaning. Integration with music &amp;amp; grocery lists are also cool, but nothing I use right now. On the other hand, the fun &amp;amp; creative workouts are a must in my daily schedule. I always look forward to the next workout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely your app of choice if you want to get fit. Outsource your fitness starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;buffer&quot;&gt;8. Buffer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t possibly explain my relation with Twitter and other social networks without &lt;a href=&quot;http://buffer.com/&quot; title=&quot;Buffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always on the go, 99% of the times I use my bicycle to travel around, so I can’t use my travel time tweeting or posting in social media like everyone does. I needed something that would allow me to timely post all the stuff I find worth sharing. Enter Buffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only the app is wonderful, but the company behind it doesn’t fall short in terms of innovation, transparency &amp;amp; company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; Their blog actually inspired &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com/blog&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;our very own blog&lt;/a&gt;, and our adoption of transparency in our company culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;swarm&quot;&gt;9. Swarm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150706swarm.png&quot; title=&quot;Swarm&quot; alt=&quot;Swarm&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;So what, I live in Horta-Guinardó FTW.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Foursquare decoupled checkins from their main app, all hell broke loose. I even quit it for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what once looked like a terrible mistake, now makes a lot of sense: Foursquare is for finding awesome places &amp;amp; for the casual user. &lt;a href=&quot;http://swarmapp.com/&quot; title=&quot;Swarm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, instead, is for the die-hard fans that want to share their location with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a large friend base using Swarm, the app is really useful. You can know whether your friends are close by, if they have already arrived to the meeting point or even discover your friends’ favourite places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’ve spent time living abroad, and I travel constantly, most of my friends are in other countries. With Swarm I keep track of a big share of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your friends don’t have Swarm, it doesn’t make much sense to use it, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wallapop&quot;&gt;10. Wallapop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a frequent traveller, you will know that owning too many things makes packing a cumbersome task. And so is moving between flats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good way to ease this, is by selling stuff you don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been a trader. I started really early in my life earning my own money by buying/selling Magic and Pokémon cards online. But eBay made it nearly impossible if you wanted to sell cheap and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wallapop is a geo-located app that allows you to sell your second hand stuff to people close to you. The mobile experience is very good, and I’m constantly selling stuff I need no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/19/wallapop-is-poised-to-disrupt-classifieds-as-accel-insight-fidelity-pack-its-war-chest/&quot; title=&quot;Techcrunch on Wallapop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;They’ve been hotly tipped as the first 1B dollar startup from Barcelona!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doing Business with your Friends or Family</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/04/07/Doing-business-with-your-friends-or-family.html" />
      <updated>2015-04-07T10:32:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/04/07/Doing-business-with-your-friends-or-family</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150407.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150407.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Business with Friends&quot; alt=&quot;Business with Friends&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Often times I read here and there that you should follow common sense when choosing your business partners. Common sense, allegedly, tells you not to choose family or friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I digress (slightly).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;separate-business-from-personal&quot;&gt;Separate business from personal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One general truth when venturing into business is trying to separate one’s business side from personal matters. And as logical as it seems, it’s very hard to follow for some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I previously said that I (slightly) digressed from that common sense, I did not mean &lt;i&gt;do choose your friends&lt;/i&gt;. In my opinion, you should choose your business partners regardless of whether they are your friends or family. They should be the best fit for your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise is simple: if you had to choose from the 10 best people in the world and your friend, fiancée or relative was amongst them, would you still choose him/her?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I agreed to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; with my two best friends, I knew they were the right people. They were the people I wanted to work with, risk my money for, and count on when skies would cloud up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also the ones that can separate business from personal matters. Finding someone who can do this is quite a real challenge, when choosing business partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;friends-over-family&quot;&gt;Friends over family&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to take one over the other, that would be friends. Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, in life you choose your friends. You don’t (always) choose your family. Some people grow more attached to family than others. I, for one, belong to those who don’t, so my opinion might slightly be biased on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the years you get to see which friends you have had along since you were a kid, which ones can you count on during hard times, which ones encourage you to move on, or which ones chickened away when in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are, if you have been best friends with someone since childhood AND he/she is a very good professional that shares goals with you, you have found your business partner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;take-all-of-this-with-a-pinch-of-salt&quot;&gt;Take all of this with a pinch of salt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By no means I am implying that all friends are a good option. People who looked like they would stand up to the challenge might turn out to be a real flop. But that could happen with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few things are as complicated as telling one of your best friends you don’t want to venture into business with him. It’s probably harder to fire him. But luckily enough, I haven’t had to fire anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General consensus exists because it’s true for the most part. So it’s advisable to follow it, if you want to play it safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, there are the exceptions. And I am happy to be amongst them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to share your experiences with doing business with friends and/or family!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Real Challenge of Internships</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/01/21/The-real-challenge-of-internships.html" />
      <updated>2015-01-21T00:57:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/01/21/The-real-challenge-of-internships</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150121.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150121.png&quot; title=&quot;Wireframes&quot; alt=&quot;Wireframes&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; You might be aware of the fact that we have recently welcomed an intern at &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;. His name is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/emiiio_rios&quot; title=&quot;Emilio Ríos on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emilio Ríos&lt;/a&gt;, and he studies at La Salle. He’ll be a Martian for some months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the general rule of thumb is “get them involved in real work”, truth is most companies employ them to get their dirty work cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous companies I have seen plenty of these situations: interns spending three to six months resizing images, changing text labels here and there, testing stuff that could be automated using the right tools, debugging Javascript libraries when they don’t even know what Javascript is, reading documentation that hasn’t been updated for ages or writing documentation no one will ever review and will therefore be lost in the shelves of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real challenge is to make their experience unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internships are, in the vast majority of the cases, the first work experience you can have. So why spending it doing worthless stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, for one, did many internships over the course of my Uni days, and most of them were crappy jobs. Reporting errors found in logs, but never fixing them; reading endless database records to manually check that migration processes ended OK, or even not having EVER to do anything for two months straight. Luckily, enough, I used that time to learn a lot of useful stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did an internship at Technische Universität München (Germany), that compensated all the worthless internships done before: good environment, friendly people, state-of-the-art technologies, free-schedule, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was an internship. And this is how it’s going to be at MarsBased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we’re doing this by constantly transmitting our core values: simpler is better, quality over quantity, state-of-the-art technologies and enjoying life at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also giving him a project of his own. Emilio is creating stuff. He’s taking decisions. We’re also correcting his mistakes, teaching him the theory so that he can learn by doing. And, hey, sometimes we learn from him as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If by the end of his internship he has learned a thing every day, learnt to value quality over quantity and looks forward to working for us or for a company similar to MarsBased, we will have successfully stood up to the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lead Tracking for Beginners</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/01/10/Lead-tracking-for-beginners.html" />
      <updated>2015-01-10T00:57:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/01/10/Lead-tracking-for-beginners</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150110.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150110.png&quot; title=&quot;Mailtrack&quot; alt=&quot;Mailtrack&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Allow me to take a break from my series of reviewing 2014 (see &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/01/08/Looking-back-to-2014-part1.html&quot; title=&quot;Looking back to 2014 part 1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;) to answer a question I get five times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I frequent the entrepreneurial scene of Barcelona, &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; has come to be an example of rapid yet sustainable growth in the eyes of other entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our growth has been caused by many reasons, one of them is having one person dedicated 100% to sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am mainly using two tools to keep track of our leads at MarsBased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mailtrack&quot;&gt;Mailtrack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mailtrack.io/en/&quot; title=&quot;Mailtrack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mailtrack&lt;/a&gt; is what every entrepreneur should use &lt;i&gt;no matter what&lt;/i&gt;. Regardless of your job title, chances are that you need to know whether your emails are read or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sent your pitch deck to an investor? Applied for public subventions? A provider takes too much to answer your emails? How about that overdue document from your lawyer? Etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put simply, Mailtrack brings Whatsapp’s doublecheck-like notifications to your inbox.
Furthermore, you can enable desktop notifications to get a pop-up every time somebody opens one of your emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protip:&lt;/strong&gt; If you receive a Mailtrack notification, it means it’s the right time to contact that person (phone, chat, twitter, what have you) because he or she will have dealt with the email in that very moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useful when&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sending emails with Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You actually follow up these notifications actively.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Need to take actions depending on recipient reading emails or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not useful in these cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can’t track mails sent from mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If mail is forwarded you can’t tell who’s who.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not accurate in mailing lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;docsend&quot;&gt;DocSend&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Straight from Silicon Valley, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.docsend.com/&quot; title=&quot;DocSend&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DocSend&lt;/a&gt; is your analytics tool for documents you send (hence their moniker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150110docsend.png&quot; title=&quot;DocSend&quot; alt=&quot;DocSend&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;DocSend's Dashboard.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docsend offers you a SaaS platform to upload your files and create custom links for each individual you want to track. By sending these links in your emails, DocSend tracks the behaviour of whoever opens the document (time spent per page, times accessed, percentage of document read, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protip:&lt;/strong&gt; You can create multiple links for a given document, to track different people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Useful cases: Sending your pitch deck ppt to investors? See in what page do they spend more time in. Sending a contract to clients? See what page do they pay more attention to, because there’ll probably a conflict of interests there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will help you if they use that online version of the document viewer. If they choose to download the file, you’ll lose the tracking (but you can disable the download option).
Also, DocSend recently announced they’re planning to end the free service for new users (&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; DocSend is not discontinuing their free service. They’ll be just granting extra privilege to long-time users. That’s why you should sign up now nevertheless!), so you might want to sign up using this link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this will help you boost your sales. At the very least, it will make you understand your customers a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know your results in the comments section!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking Back to 2014 (part 1)</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/01/08/Looking-back-to-2014-part1.html" />

      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2015/01/08/Looking-back-to-2014-part1</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20150108.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150108.png&quot; title=&quot;Travel&quot; alt=&quot;Travel&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; One year ago I went through a life-changing experience. Today, looking back to the year that just finished, I find hard to believe all that’s happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150108.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Àlex at Googleplex&quot; alt=&quot;Àlex at Googleplex&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;There's no treatment for this yet. Someone please help this guy!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends hate me because all I posted on Facebook back then was my daily burrito. But there’s more to my trip than my daily dose of Mexican goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;san-francisco&quot;&gt;San Francisco&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On December 25th, 2013 — yes, X-mas day — I landed in San Francisco, only three days after quitting my previous job at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vass.es&quot; title=&quot;VASS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;VASS&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to start a new life: new year, new continent, new home, new (read: no) job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some months of conceiving &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;, I was finally able to make it official, while my two other partners kept their jobs, like planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In almost three months in San Francisco I spread the MarsBased word but didn’t get a single project (oh, yes, one worth 700€ that’s still on hold — lucky us!). However, all that I learnt there helped shape what is MarsBased today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the San Franciscan open-mindedness I could meet the guys at Thoughtbot, Google, Twitter, Facebook, and other leading tech companies. From each and every one of them something valuable. Their advise sharpened my pitch and gave me new ideas to bring into the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only that, but I also got to fulfil one of my dreams: visiting Google’s offices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;uncertainty&quot;&gt;Uncertainty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However good my first impression of business in the USA was, it would not allow me to live off MarsBased that fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our company did not have a clear pitch and it certainly did not look solid and/or mature enough for American standards. I can understand no one would risk their money on such a young company, as we had neither references nor portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was not allowed to look for a job in the USA because of my tourist condition, I applied for some remote jobs, or some jobs in Barcelona. I even did an interview for Uber Barcelona back when it didn’t exist, but I didn’t make it through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed a change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learning-from-the-beststartup-grind&quot;&gt;Learning from the best — Startup Grind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the Eventbrite digest emails I found something called Startup Grind. A three-day event held in Mountain View, garnering entrepreneurs from all over the globe and massive speakers: Y-Combinator, Andreesen &amp;amp; Horowitz, LinkedIn, 500Startups, etc. I was kinda broke but spent my money there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be one of the best investments of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended the three days learning from the best, meeting other like-minded people and absorbing the Startup Grind values. That made me want to apply to create the Barcelona chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did. And after the assessment process, I became the Chapter Director for Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the Summit, I made so many contacts (&lt;i&gt;friends&lt;/i&gt;, according to Startup Grind values!) and learnt from their stories that I thought I could also do it myself. Somewhere around that moment I decided to quit job-hunting and committed to build the Martian spaceship using all my dedication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by committing full time, we had our very first success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;definitely-life-changing&quot;&gt;Definitely life-changing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20150108java.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Java book&quot; alt=&quot;Java book&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;I too have abandoned Java (and Hibernate) for good.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other major accomplishments while in SF were definitely eating three burritos in a day, waking up in a different city after a birthday party, finding abandoned Java books in the street (see picture), finding a Catalan restaurant, discovering that tofu &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; be tasteful, trolling a Rails meeting, frequenting way too many tech parties, hanging out with CEOs of startups you now might use but they were just and idea one year ago (DocSend, 8fit), spotting awesome license plates (CHSBRGR, IWHINE2) or meeting more Germans in two months in SF than in two years in Munich (approx).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are plenty of reasons to say my 2014 has been awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s only the first two months of the year. Wait for the next entries to read about the rest!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Practice Makes the Master (The Sayan Path)</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/12/12/Practice-makes-the-master-the-sayan-path.html" />
      <updated>2014-12-12T00:57:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/12/12/Practice-makes-the-master-the-sayan-path</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20141212.jpeg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20141212.jpeg&quot; title=&quot;Super Sayans fighting&quot; alt=&quot;Super Sayans fighting&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Two Saiyans fighting each other. If none wins, they both become stronger, and this is what we’d call a deadlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous entry I spoke about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/12/11/I-love-telling-stories.html&quot; title=&quot;I love telling stories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how much do I like sharing stories with the people I know&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, I am far from satisfied with the outcome of my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all these years, I have never felt like I was delivering 100% in terms of writing, and after giving it some thought, I came to the following conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I mostly wrote stuff for other people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am not very good at writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the first conclusion is as easy to solve as to keep this Medium account active, the second one is way more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to overcome difficulties in life. My modus operandi has got two simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn from people better than me.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first clause is self-explanatory, nothing more than rephrasing the quote “if you’re the smartest person in the room, then you’re in the wrong room”, the second clause needs to be clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a kid, I grew up to Dragon Ball. In Dragon Ball some characters belong to a race called Saiyans, who are constantly fighting. Saiyans have mastered the art of war, and grow stronger after each defeating battle. This way, they can stand up to bigger challenges, facing more powerful enemies every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to write a pretentious blog post about “&lt;i&gt;10 things writers/entrepreneurs/painters/whathaveyou can learn from Dragon Ball&lt;/i&gt;”, this would be number one: be a Saiyan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you can’t be a Saiyan for the same reason you can’t be Batman or a Unicorn, I would suggest: practice to improve. Practice so you can fail, and practice so you can improve. But do practice as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I wanted to write a new year resolution to write a blog post each day of the year, from January, 1st 2015. But I could not wait, so I started already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice, practice, practice, and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Love Telling Stories</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/12/11/I-love-telling-stories.html" />
      <updated>2014-12-11T00:57:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/12/11/I-love-telling-stories</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20141211.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20141211.png&quot; title=&quot;People talking&quot; alt=&quot;People talking&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Throughout the years, I have tried many ways of making my writings available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have run blogs of my own and some shared, volunteered at some local magazines, published writings in forums &amp;amp; websites - back when phpBB was cool -, collaborated as an ex-pat when I was living in Germany for a major Spanish newspaper, wrote stuff for other people, helped translate some books and done some guest blogging. All of this I have tried to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest I have gotten to “tell stories” have been my last two years actively tweeting my professional conversion from old-school consultant to running my own business at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Twitter is not meant for that. I believe that Twitter is an awesome platform for many things, but for me is most of the time a good way to “think out loud”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also run the blogs at MarsBased and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.startupgrind.com/barcelona&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Barcelona&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind BCN&lt;/a&gt; 95% of the time. But the beauty in these two blogs is precisely not writing too much. Only when it feels right and when the content suits the corporate strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need some platform that allows me to write more often, about a broader range of topics, where I represent only me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to test this &lt;a href=&quot;http://medium.com/@lexrodba&quot; title=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit on Medium&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; thingie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks simple and elegant. Stuff for writers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Does Barcelona Need the Startup Grind?</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/02/16/Why-does-Barcelona-need-the-Startup-Grind.html" />
      <updated>2014-02-16T09:00:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/02/16/Why-does-Barcelona-need-the-Startup-Grind</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20140216.jpg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20140216.jpg&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind&quot; alt=&quot;Startup Grind&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Hi again! It’s Àlex, and you might know me from previous posts &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/02/03/First-Connections-in-San-Francisco.html&quot; title=&quot;First connections in San Francisco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“First connections in SF”&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/01/10/Embarking-as-an-Entrepreneur-in-San-Francisco.html&quot; title=&quot;Embarking as an entrepreneur in San Francisco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Embarking as an entrepreneur in SF”&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I attended 2014’s Startup Grind Annual Summit. It was the first big entrepreneurial event for both &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt; and me. A very big opportunity for both parties, indeed: global exposure, first-class speeches, loads of networking…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I found out that the biggest oportunity was nor for MarsBased neither for me. It was for Barcelona. Let me tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-concept-startup-grind&quot;&gt;The concept: Startup Grind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, let me introduce you to the Startup Grind. The Startup Grind is a monthly event that aims to create community amongst entrepreneurs. It started in 2010 in the Bay Area with only 9 attendees in their first edition, and nowadays it’s being held in 75 cities, in 30 different countries, all around the globe. And, lo and behold, it’s being backed by Google for Entrepreneurs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video is worth (more than) a thousand words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3c6E0sWd53A&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some weeks before the start of the event I had been learning about the event’s philosophy: this is not a common start-up meet-and-greet event, meant only to network and generate business. Simply put, the Startup Grind promotes the values of collaboration, friendship and altruism which defy the ever-changing, incredibly competitive and aggressive entrepreneurial scene of the Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principles of the Startup Grind are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Give, don’t take.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make friends, not contacts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help others before helping yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other events I would have met Rallyware, 3DLT, Chopdawg, Tripscale, DocSend, but in this one I met Jake, Jeet, Mykhail, Ada, Kristof, Ryan, Sarah, Kingsley, Russ and a bunch of other names that I will not forget. I didn’t meet companies, I met people. I met friends. I have already met a couple of them after the event and plan to visit many more in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more I read, listened and learnt, the more I saw an opportunity for my beloved city. I SO wanted to bring this event and culture to Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-city-barcelona&quot;&gt;The city: Barcelona&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barcelona has got everything to become one of the top European cities for entrepreneurs. It’s got an awesome clima, a business-oriented mentality, first-class working spaces and it’s well connected to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barcelona has also been for a bunch of years now the home of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/&quot; title=&quot;Mobile World Congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt;. The MWC garners celebrities, investors, big corporations and lots of interesting ideas, bringing them all together to Barcelona. Why can’t we dream of building something similar for start-ups?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s heaps of interesting start-ups from Barcelona: Social Point, Goodorama, The Social Coin, Redbooth (formerly known as Teambox),Softonic, Onebox, Icebergs… and many others that just landed here because they too think that Barcelona is an awesome city to live and work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I have the feeling that there’s not enough sense of community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest trend of creating co-working spaces and Meetup groups is definitely pushing the community a step forward. In fact, I do know them very well myself: I created one circle of start-ups and collaborate with a couple of groups, and my feelings are that most of them are creating micro-communities, instead of getting to know one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-challenge-bringing-startup-grind-to-barcelona&quot;&gt;The challenge: Bringing Startup Grind to Barcelona&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I requested a Startup Grind Chapter for Barcelona. And hooray for me: my petition was accepted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapters are the local representation of Startup Grind in other cities of the world. There are chapters in Chicago, Berlin, Los Angeles, Paris and so on. Moreover, in the Startup Grind world map there’s no pin in Spain, and it pains me beyond reason to see Barcelona devoid of such an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can’t do this alone. For this project I will need a loyal team to commit to the task of changing the Barcelona start-up scene for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not an easy task. We will have to endure rejection, loads of work, no economical support whatsoever and most of all, getting our hands dirty with tasks we’ve never done before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other side, we will learn a lot. We will grow together, as startup grinders and as persons. We will meet amazing people and we can do whatever we enjoy the most and do best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence, it is like creating a start-up. Welcome to entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in collaboration, shoot me an email at &lt;strong&gt;abacardit at startupgrind dot com&lt;/strong&gt; and welcome onboard!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Connections in San Francisco</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/02/03/First-Connections-in-San-Francisco.html" />
      <updated>2014-02-03T09:00:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/02/03/First-Connections-in-San-Francisco</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20140203.jpg' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20140203.jpg&quot; title=&quot;San Francisco&quot; alt=&quot;San Francisco&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Hi everyone, it’s Àlex again. Remember the Martian who wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/01/10/Embarking-as-an-Entrepreneur-in-San-Francisco.html&quot; title=&quot;Embarking as an entrepreneur in San Francisco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; some weeks ago? That’s me, and I am here to write the second part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For first-time readers, here’s my long story short: quit my job in Barcelona. Landed in San Francisco. Started a new life. Life is being awesome so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised, in this entry I will tell you how did I get connected to the most thrilling entrepreneurial scene in a jiffy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, I would like to announce that I will be representing MarsBased in the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://startupgrind.com/2014/&quot; title=&quot;Startup Grind Global Summit 2014&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Grind 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-hail-the-glory-of-meetup&quot;&gt;All hail the glory of Meetup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://meetup.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Meetup&quot;&gt;Meetup.com&lt;/a&gt; might be terrible for some things: you get s***loads of e-mails of recurring events, multi-group events will land multiple times in your inbox, it tries to hard to be a social network while lacking critical features, and it’s got a slow and not very intuitive mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s an awesome tool to get to know new people. Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a good couple of hours in my first day in SF just researching groups that were strictly related to my field of work: start-ups, development, growth hacking, entrepreneurship, hackathons, etc. Not only did I sign up for all the events, but I also jumped in the most random stuff Meetup suggested I check. Just for the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it turned out to be the best decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a matter of fact, my first event was a Dinner Crawl (eat 4 courses in 4 different restaurants) and my second one, the Beer Olympics. None of them were tech-related even in the slightest. Yet in these two events I mingled with Project Managers at Cisco, Interns at Twitter and other sorts of tech-related people. After all, we’re in the capital city of innovation, so no wonder that such events are populated by the most brilliant minds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, for the last month, I’ve been hitting all sorts of events. Some tech-related, some just crazy stuff. It’s not about the event itself, it’s about the people who you meet there, and what you make out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;eventbrite-to-help-you-focus&quot;&gt;Eventbrite to help you focus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order not to get distracted with so many multi-disciplinar events, I use Eventbrite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventbrite is more business-oriented, and it’s got a ticketing system. So even if you’re using it to promote a party, at least you know there’s something slightly well prepared behind it. It can either be a free or a paid event, but you still need to RSVP as if you actually bought a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal order of preference, Eventbrite events get my attention more often than Meetup events. But it’s a matter of taste and by no means a general rule. And, of course, there are other sources of events outside of Meetup and Eventbrite that I might not even be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cold-e-mail-marketing-style&quot;&gt;Cold e-mail: Marketing-style!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventbrite and Meetup are great for joining the scene and getting started, but they can be very disperse. Often times you might want to focus on meeting someone special, or talk to &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; particular company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that, I used cold e-mail. For the non-marketers, cold e-mail is the art of sending someone an e-mail introducing yourself trying to get something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a city where no one knows where’s the next Twitter / Snapchat / Whatsapp / etc going to spring up from, it’s very common to send &amp;amp; receive such e-mails. And it’s also very common to read them, answer them and politely agree on a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So right after getting my basic needs covered (accommodation-wise, mostly) on my first week, I started cold e-mailing everyone. I shot e-mails to CEOs of companies I would like to talk to, thought leaders, investors and mostly important people whose contacts I might need. Of course, I was bringing some kind of value to them. While everyone will agree on meeting you, it’s not advisable to make them lose their time. So make sure your elevator pitch is ready to be used on a daily basis. You’ve got ten or thirty minutes to impress them. Afterwards, they might be gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be brave. Try it. You’ll be surprised of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;contacts-of-contacts&quot;&gt;Contacts of contacts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least: the traditional way. Get referred, for whatever thing you might want to do here. It’s a shortcut to getting to know the right people. People who otherwise would put off reading your e-mail for next week, are more likely to read your e-mail if you’re referred by someone they trust. It’s sensible: I would do that as well, and so would you, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty sure that everyone has got an amazing network of contacts here, and so far, everyone has been kindly sharing it with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might have to do with the fact that San Francisco is a major destination for immigrants in the US. Thus, everyone has surely had someone to help them previously, and now it’s their turn to give their help back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell: this is not a “do this and you’ll get results immediately”. This is my personal experience and meant to be taken like that, like a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I’d love to hear your experiences as well. Comment here or drop me a line at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:alex.rodriguez@marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;Àlex Rodríguez Bacardit email&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;alex.rodriguez@marsbased.com&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows, I might be able to help you somehow :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Embarking as an Entrepreneur in San Francisco</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/01/10/Embarking-as-an-Entrepreneur-in-San-Francisco.html" />
      <updated>2014-01-10T09:00:00+01:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2014/01/10/Embarking-as-an-Entrepreneur-in-San-Francisco</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/20140110.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/20140110.png&quot; title=&quot;San Francisco&quot; alt=&quot;San Francisco&quot; class=&quot;fit image&quot; /&gt; Hi everyone, I’m one of the three Martians that founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://marsbased.com&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarsBased&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strike&gt;an offshore development start-up&lt;/strike&gt; a development consultancy highly specialized in Ruby on Rails applications. Truth be told, however, my name is Àlex and I am from the beautiful city of Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I quit my job on the 20th of December to pursuit one of my biggest dreams: travel overseas and get to know San Francisco. This way, I could learn about the city, the country, and expand the MarsBased gospel. I will stay here until the 1st of March. I am collaborating with &lt;a href=&quot;http://barcelonaventures.com/&quot; title=&quot;Barcelona Ventures website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barcelona Ventures&lt;/a&gt; on its blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there might be other people like me, I’d like to give them some advice. I had little to no time to plan anything before coming, and that might as well be your case. Just make sure you read this blog entry on the plane, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three big tasks you need to do in your first days. You can do all of them at once, or you can do them sequentially, depending on how good are you at multi-tasking. Here’s my two cents on how to tackle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-task-get-the-essentials&quot;&gt;First task: get the essentials&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can technically secure a room from overseas, don’t rush it. It’s going to be cheaper to find it from here. Crash at a friend’s or else book a hostel room for some days. We’ll talk about this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to start working your way up from the very first day you need a phone. Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://graphics.wsj.com/PhonePlan/?mg=inert-wsj&quot; title=&quot;WSJ's Wireless Savings Calculator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this tool&lt;/a&gt; to find your ideal voice&amp;amp;data plan according to your needs. Why relying on asynchronous communication (E-mail, AirBnB messages…) when you can just call someone while you’re actually heading towards your destination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for moving around, get your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/index.do&quot; title=&quot;Clipper Card&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clipper Card&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the San Francisco public transportation pass. Depending on your needs, you might want to acquire the monthly pass, which ranges between 60-70 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full disclaimer: compared to some European countries, SF public transportation is very slow. Has a great coverage around the city and can get you everywhere, but just be aware that it might take more time than you thought. However, Google Maps is you best friend here: the public transportation estimations are really accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re travelling on a broader budget, you might want to take a look at these two fantastic apps: &lt;a href=&quot;http://uber.com&quot; title=&quot;Uber&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://lyft.com&quot; title=&quot;Lyft&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lyft&lt;/a&gt;. They are carsharing apps that solve perfectly one of the main problems of this city: it’s difficult to find a cab when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;second-task-house-hunting&quot;&gt;Second task: house hunting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re up and running, you can devote all your efforts to look for a place to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mostly relied on these three sources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Circle of friends (of friends)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AirBnB&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Craigslist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I flew to SF, I did a small research through my Facebook contacts to check whether I had friends or close contacts that I might contact. Came across a couple of them, and send out some e-mails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was through a fourth grade connection that I found my private room in the quiet neighbourhood of Noe Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t got much to say here: just be super-nice. Be yourself and tell them your story. Chances are, everyone has a friend which knows someone who’s friends with someone whose neighbour is looking for a flatmate. Just make sure you’re that flatmate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the sites, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airbnb.com/&quot; title=&quot;AirBnB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AirBnB&lt;/a&gt; provides a nice selection of flats but a little more expensive than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigslist.org&quot; title=&quot;Craiglist&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Craigslist&lt;/a&gt;. Just choose your target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that San Francisco is one hell of an expensive city. As a matter of fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archives.sfexaminer.com/sanfrancisco/new-numbers-show-san-francisco-has-nations-highest-rents/Content?oid=2626465&quot; title=&quot;San Francisco is the most expensive US city&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SF is the most expensive US city for rent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices for a private room downtown start from 1500 dollars a month. That is, four times more than what I’m paying for my room in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for something cheaper, you can either take a look in more residential districts (further from the city center) or else in Oakland or Berkeley. These two smaller yet cozy cities, lie on the other side of the Bay. Depending on your needs, they might suit you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;third-task-get-connected&quot;&gt;Third task: get connected&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty hectic city. Everything happens very fast, and you’ve got to get used to it. It’s not that they rush things, it’s their rhythm. Love it or hate it, you can still take your “un espresso” or “una siesta”, but you might be missing out on important events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice here is &lt;i&gt;technology is your best friend&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From day zero, scrutinize &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com&quot; title=&quot;Meetup&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meetup&lt;/a&gt; and join loads of groups. Participate in all the events that might interest you even in the slightest. You never know where your best contact may spring up from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From start-up stuff and entrepreneurial contests, to beer pong competitions (they call beer the social lubricant for a reason), there’s a Meetup group for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a more professional level, &lt;a href=&quot;http://eventbrite.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Eventbrite&quot;&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt; will get you other sort of events. Just choose your preferences and jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it’s not only about joining events. Take a minute to talk to everyone you meet. Everyone has got a couple of minutes to chat with you, and will most likely hear your story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a city where everyone has worked for Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Google, and many big others, you’d probably expect them to ignore small fish like you. Quite surprisingly, it couldn’t be farther from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is extra-nice around here and will introduce you to their group of friends. Act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ok-got-it-now-what&quot;&gt;Ok, got it. Now what?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next blog entry I’ll highlight the best events I have attended so far and which ones I look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cookin.me: Where All Your Recipes Want to Be!</title>
      <link href="http://www.alexrodba.com/2013/09/20/Cookinme-where-all-your-recipes-want-to-be.html" />
      <updated>2013-09-20T06:00:00+02:00</updated>
      <id>http://www.alexrodba.com/2013/09/20/Cookinme-where-all-your-recipes-want-to-be</id>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/post2-d57bc3b4.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;Some of you want to know what’s going on in the MarsBased headquarters, right? We can not reveal much, but we can tell you we’re indeed &lt;em&gt;cookin’&lt;/em&gt; something!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us introduce you to “Cookin.me”. Cookin.me is our soon-to-be first product, consisting in a web application for managing cooking recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cookin.me features an easy, clean and intuitive user interface that will help you organize your cooking recipes the way you want: create cookbooks and move recipes between them. The smooth transitions provide a pleasant experience when combined with in-line editing. You will breeze through your recipes collection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;full-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/post2-d57bc3b4.png&quot; title=&quot;Cookin.me&quot; alt=&quot;Cookin.me&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;Some of our favourite recipes!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to try Cookin.me, you will need to wait a little longer. We’re currently finishing the development, and completely changing the way it looks. We are adapting to the newest and trendiest &lt;em&gt;look&amp;amp;feels&lt;/em&gt; and opted for a flat design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks awesome, actually, but if you want to see it, you’ll need to stay alert in the social networks or else subscribe to our newsletter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ok, ok, I got it, but why another recipe app in the market?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are currently heaps of recipe applications in the market: but none of them features such a beautiful user interface. Believe us, after analysing the market, we felt there was something missing in each and every recipe app we’ve tested. Loads of button-bloated toolbars, excessive functionality, old-fashioned look&amp;amp;feels, last-century table-based designs, pixelated logos and imagery, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why so complicated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think differently: Simpler is better. We prefer releasing a product that does half the things but works as intended, rather than a half a product working 50% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not all we do: we, at MarsBased, enjoy creating our own products as well as working for others as long as they fit in with the MarsBased philosophy: simpler is better, global products, effective designs, state-of-the-art technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment, though, we’ve just started building up relationships around the net. As a starting company, we have been walking the initial steps of creating a company: defining strategies, building a splash website, creating a corporate image and learning to work together. As a matter of fact, we’ve launched our website and our social profiles barely two weeks ago!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we want more! We’ve already started making some noise ‘round the net! If you want to be the first to read our messages and keep updated on our endeavours, try following us in the social networks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/MarsBased&quot; title=&quot;MarsBased on Twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Actually, the Cookin.me roadmap is quite clear, but we would definitely love to hear your thoughts on that. Got a nice idea for it? Tell us and we might include it as a feature, and you will be eligible for being a beta tester! Use our social profiles or &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#108;&amp;#097;&amp;#064;&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#115;&amp;#098;&amp;#097;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&quot;&gt;send us an e-mail&lt;/a&gt; like it’s still 1994!&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.alexrodba.com/images/fulls/post1-20de06ba.png' width='400' height='300'><br><p>]]>&lt;p&gt;Today is the day. This blog celebrates its first post and after it the whole MarsBased machinery is taking off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MarsBased crew have been eagerly anticipating this moment for some months now and we are raring to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;vertical-img&quot;&gt;

  &lt;img src=&quot;/images/fulls/post1-20de06ba.png&quot; title=&quot;Rocket take-off&quot; alt=&quot;Rocket take-off&quot; class=&quot;fit image &quot; /&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;img-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commencing countdown (five), engines on (four). (three) (two) Check ignition (one) and may God’s (blastoff) love be with you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcyuKUtgyZ8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Bowie - Space Oddity&lt;/a&gt; in our minds, we packed a few personal belongings and lots of illusion, took our luggage and set off onto a new start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here we are: inside our spaceship, heading towards our new destination. Life’s too good up here. It is, indeed, a promising start for our trip to a brighter future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will keep you updated, but if you want to get to know us a little better, you might want to follow us through our social profiles:&lt;/p&gt;
